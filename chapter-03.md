# Chapter 3: First Shoot

The desert night was surprisingly bright. Moonlight painted the lot in silver and shadow, the Milky Way vivid overhead. The emptiness amplified everything.

"Light meter's reading 2.8 at ISO 400," Kevin reported. "We can shoot available light or add floods."

"Available light first," Nathan decided. He wanted the moonlit atmosphere. "Floods only if needed."

They spread out with equipment. Nathan mounted the main Bolex on the tripod, framing his first shot: the screen from ground level, shooting up so it filled the frame. The graffiti was barely visible, just darker shapes against white paint.

He adjusted focus manually, feeling the lens ring click. Everything about 16mm was tactile, deliberate. No instant playback, no autofocus. You wasted expensive film if you didn't know what you were doing.

"Rolling," he announced, and pressed the trigger. The camera's mechanism whirred softly—twelve frames per second, eating through the 400-foot magazine. He held the shot for thirty seconds, letting the stillness speak. Then cut.

"That's going to be beautiful," Samantha said. She was shooting stills with her Minolta, bracketing exposures to make sure she caught the moonlight correctly. "The texture of that paint. The scale."

Greg stood twenty feet away with the boom mic and reel-to-reel, headphones on, eyes closed. Kevin monitored from a distance. Lisa had wandered toward the speaker posts with the second Bolex, filming close-ups of rust and peeling paint.

"Next setup," Nathan called. "Handheld tracking shot along the posts."

Kevin brought the shoulder mount while Nathan swapped lenses. Handheld was risky with film—every step would show—but he wanted the movement.

He lifted the camera onto his shoulder. "Everyone quiet. Rolling."

He walked slowly between speaker posts, capturing each one. Twenty, thirty, forty posts extending into shadow. Wind created that eerie whistle—high-pitched and rhythmic.

Halfway down, he stopped. The sound had changed. The whistle had become more complex, almost musical. He kept filming, turning to capture the entire lot—screen, snack bar, playground skeletal against stars.

"Cut," he said finally, lowering the camera. His shoulder ached from the weight.

"Beautiful tracking shot," Samantha said. "You got the whole geography in one move."

"The sound," Nathan said. "Did you hear how it changed?"

"Wind through metal," Kevin said. "Different posts produce different tones depending on corrosion patterns. It's like an aeolian harp."

Greg pulled off his headphones, expression troubled. "It's not just wind. Listen to the playback."

He rewound the tape and pressed play. Through the small speaker they heard Nathan's footsteps, the camera's mechanical whir, and underneath—the whistle of wind through posts. But there was something else now that they were listening for it. A low, rhythmic sound. Almost like music.

"Organ music," Lisa said quietly. "Like old theater organs."

Kevin frowned. "It's resonance. The hollow posts acting as tubes. Same principle as a pipe organ."

"Maybe," Greg said. He didn't sound convinced.

Nathan checked his shot list. "Playground next, then snack bar. Save the booth for last."

They worked steadily for the next hour. Nathan directing. Kevin managing audio. Lisa capturing texture. Samantha photographing and taking notes.

The playground was particularly unsettling. Skeletal jungle gym, chains hanging from the swing set, stark shadows. Nathan shot from multiple angles. A family space turned menacing through absence.

"Kids used to play here between films," Samantha said. "Family-friendly. There was even a petting zoo in the sixties."

"What happened?" Greg asked.

"Economics," Kevin said. "Maintenance costs, liability."

Nathan moved to the snack bar, filming its boarded windows and collapsed roof. The CONCESSIONS sign still hung above the entrance, letters faded but legible. Through his viewfinder he could see inside where the ceiling had fallen—twisted metal studs and broken tile, exposed to the elements.

"I'm going to check inside," Samantha announced. "Look for period details, anything interesting."

"Stay where we can see you," Kevin called.

She picked her way through the entrance, flashlight in one hand and camera in the other. Nathan kept filming as she disappeared into shadow, then reemerged in one of the side rooms where the roof was still intact.

"Oh, this is good," her voice echoed out. "Nathan, you need to see this."

He left the camera on the tripod and joined her, Kevin following with a flood light. The room had been an office—there was still a metal desk pushed against one wall, filing cabinets with drawers hanging open. But what caught Nathan's attention was the wall.

Posters. Movie posters from 1972, still taped to the concrete. The Godfather with Marlon Brando's shadowed face. Deliverance with its ominous tagline. The Poseidon Adventure. What's Up, Doc? All the films that had played here in those final months before the fire.

"These are original one-sheets," Samantha breathed, documenting them with her camera. "They'd be worth money in good condition, but they're water-damaged. Still, the fact that they're here..."

Nathan ran his fingers over The Godfather poster, feeling the brittle paper. This had been here eleven years. Through summers and winters, monsoons and heat. Holding onto the wall like the Stardust itself was holding onto the past.

"Look at this," Kevin said. He'd found menus in one of the desk drawers—laminated cards with prices and offerings. "Hot dogs fifty cents. Popcorn twenty-five cents. Coke forty cents."

"Different world," Nathan murmured.

Samantha was photographing everything, creating a catalog. She found ticket stubs in a drawer, time cards for employees, a schedule book with screenings listed through October 19, 1972. The day before the fire.

"Rollins kept everything," she said. "This is a complete record of operations right up to the end."

Nathan picked up the schedule book, paging through it carefully. Different handwriting for different entries. Some neat and careful—probably Rollins himself. Others rushed, scattered. Some in distinctive slanted script that appeared mostly in the projection booth maintenance log.

"Dalton Reed's handwriting," Samantha confirmed, looking over his shoulder. "See the difference? Rollins wrote like a businessman. Reed wrote like..." She paused. "Like every letter mattered. Like writing was sacred."

The maintenance log was meticulous. Every screening logged with film title, start time, any technical issues. Notes about bulb replacement, film splicing, cleaning schedules. The last entry was October 19, 1972: "Bulb changed. Godfather print shows wear on reel 3, needs attention after final screening. Sound system running hot, monitor during show."

The next day, Dalton had burned it all down.

Nathan felt a chill despite the warm desert night. They were walking through the last day of this place's life, documented in careful handwriting by the man who would kill nine people.

"We should get this on film," he said.

They spent another twenty minutes shooting the office—the posters, the desk, the schedule book. Nathan framed shots to show the dates, the proximity to the fire. Documentary evidence building a narrative.

When they emerged, Greg was waiting outside, visibly agitated.

"The audio's fucked," he said bluntly. "I keep getting interference. Voices."

"Let's hear it," Nathan said.

Greg played back the last ten minutes. Clear at first—their voices in the office, the rustle of paper, footsteps. Then, underneath, something else started bleeding through. Faint at first, then stronger. Multiple voices in conversation. No words clear enough to make out, but unmistakably human speech.

Then laughter. Brief, almost hidden in the static, but there.

"CB radio," Kevin said immediately. "Has to be. Truck stop's only ten miles away. Atmospheric conditions are bouncing the signal."

"At two in the morning?" Greg demanded. "Who's on CB radios at two AM?"

"Truckers. They drive all night."

"It doesn't sound like radio. It sounds like..." Greg struggled for words. "Like it's here. Like it's coming from the lot."

Lisa had been quiet throughout, filming the speaker posts. She lowered her camera now, expression troubled.

"I keep feeling like we're being watched," she said. "I know that sounds paranoid. But every time I look through the viewfinder, I get this sense that someone's looking back."

"Camera fatigue," Kevin said. "Your eyes are adjusting constantly to the eyepiece, it creates perceptual artifacts."

"Maybe." Lisa didn't sound convinced.

Nathan looked at his watch—a battered Timex that glowed pale green. 2:37 AM. They'd been shooting for over two hours. The generator had another three hours of fuel, but they were all getting tired. And the atmosphere was getting to them, he could feel it. The isolation, the silence broken only by wind, the weight of nine deaths hanging over everything.

"One more setup," he said. "I want the projection booth. Exterior only, we're not going inside tonight. Just establish it visually, show it watching over the lot."

They walked toward it together. The booth sat on its raised platform, accessed by wooden stairs that looked half-rotted. In the moonlight it was a squat concrete bunker, windows like empty eyes. The padlock on the door glinted dully.

Nathan set up the tripod and framed his shot—low angle, looking up at the booth with the screen massive behind it. The geometry was perfect: the booth small and dark in the foreground, the screen towering above, both of them abandoned sentinels over empty ground.

"Rolling," he announced.

Through the viewfinder he tracked slowly up the booth's concrete wall to the windows. Empty. Dark. Nothing moving inside.

Then, for just a second—a flicker of movement in the left window. Like someone stepping back from view.

Nathan's hand jerked, and the camera bobbled. He steadied it, kept filming, but his heart was hammering. Had he seen that? Or was it a trick of moonlight and shadow?

"Cut," he said. His voice sounded tight.

"You okay?" Samantha asked.

"Fine. Thought I saw something move in the window."

Everyone turned to look at the booth. The windows stared back, black and empty.

"Probably a bird," Kevin said. "Or debris shifting."

"Yeah," Nathan said. "Probably."

But he didn't believe it. And from the look on Lisa's face, she didn't either.

"We should call it," Kevin said. "We're all tired, we're seeing things. Let's review footage, get some sleep, come back at it in daylight."

Nathan wanted to argue—he wanted to climb those stairs right now, break that padlock, see what was inside. But Kevin was right. They were exhausted and jumpy, and night photography was difficult enough without adding paranoia to the mix.

"Alright," he agreed reluctantly. "Pack it up. We'll tackle the booth properly tomorrow."

As they gathered equipment and headed back to camp, Nathan couldn't shake the feeling they were leaving something unfinished. The booth sat behind them on its platform, windows dark and watching.

And somewhere in that darkness, something watched back.
