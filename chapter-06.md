# Chapter 6: Investigating the Booth

Kevin didn't sleep. He watched the projection booth through the window, hand-crank flashlight ready. The others dozed fitfully—even Nathan slumped against the wall, camera in his lap. Kevin stayed alert, military training overriding exhaustion.

At 5:47 AM, the sky lightened. Not sunrise, but enough light to see.

"I'm going back to the booth," he announced.

Nathan jerked awake. "Now?"

"We need answers. I want to search properly, find the power source, understand this."

"I'm coming," Nathan said.

Samantha stood. "Me too."

Lisa stayed curled in her corner. Greg shook his head but didn't argue.

Kevin gathered tools—flashlight, multimeter, screwdriver set. Approach it like a technical problem. Find mechanisms, trace systems, identify the operator.

They crossed the lot in the pre-dawn light. The desert was gray and formless, the screen a dark rectangle against the lightening sky. The projection booth waited on its platform, windows empty and dark. No light, no movement. Just concrete and broken glass.

At the top of the stairs, Kevin tried the door.

It opened.

Not locked anymore. Not even latched. The door swung inward on protesting hinges, revealing the booth's interior. Kevin paused, every instinct screaming trap. Last night it had been locked from inside, Kevin pounding on it while the projector ran. Now it was open like an invitation.

"Someone unlocked it," Nathan said quietly.

"Or it was never locked," Kevin countered. "Sticky latch, we didn't pull hard enough—"

"You threw your shoulder into it. I saw the door flex. It was locked."

Kevin had no answer for that. He stepped inside, flashlight raised.

The projection booth looked exactly as it had the night before. The massive carbon-arc projector dominated the space, reels above and below, the mechanism silent and still. Film canisters lined the shelves. Dust covered everything in a thin layer.

Kevin moved to the projector and placed his palm on the housing. Warm. Not hot, but definitely warmer than ambient temperature. The metal held residual heat from recent operation.

"It was running," he said. "Within the last few hours. This thing holds heat."

He followed the power cables. They'd been cut years ago—the copper wires corroded and green with oxidation where they'd been severed. No power had flowed through these lines in over a decade.

But someone had jury-rigged an alternative. Kevin found it behind the projector: a crude but effective battery bank. Six car batteries—Interstate brand, the labels recent—wired in series to produce the voltage needed for the carbon-arc system. Cables ran from the batteries to the projector's power input, bypassing the building's dead electrical system entirely.

"Son of a bitch," Kevin muttered. He tested the batteries with his multimeter. 8.2 volts, 9.1, 7.8—all partially drained but functional. "Someone's been maintaining this. These batteries are maybe a year old. You can see the manufacturing dates."

"How would they charge them?" Nathan asked, filming the battery bank.

"Take them to town, charge at a gas station or library, bring them back. Or use solar panels somewhere. Either way, this is ongoing. Whoever's here has been doing this regularly."

Samantha was at the shelves, examining film canisters. "The organization is meticulous. Alphabetical by title, dated by acquisition. Some of these go back to the sixties." She pulled down a leather-bound book. "And this is the logbook."

She opened it carefully, pages crackling. The handwriting was small and precise, each entry dated.

"October 12, 1983," she read aloud. "Wednesday evening showing: The French Connection for the Morrison family. They appreciated the realism. Attendance: excellent. No technical difficulties."

She flipped back through pages. "October 9, 1983: Sunday matinee: The Poseidon Adventure. Mr. Rollins particularly enjoyed the capsized set design. October 5: Deliverance for a full house..."

"He's listing the victims," Nathan said quietly. "The nine people who died. He thinks they're still here, still watching."

Samantha kept reading, going further back. The entries were consistent—three to four screenings per week, different films, always noting the "audience's" reaction. The handwriting stayed precise for years, then began to deteriorate. By 1980 it was sprawling, harder to read. By 1982 it was almost illegible in places—manic scratches and corrections.

But recent entries had steadied. Still obsessive, still delusional, but neater. Like whoever was writing them had found some kind of equilibrium in their madness.

"This is Dalton Reed," Samantha said with certainty. "Has to be. Who else would catalog screenings in an abandoned drive-in for eleven years?"

"A squatter. Urban explorer. Someone using the location—" Kevin started.

"Read this," Samantha interrupted, pointing to an entry from 1973. "January 14, 1973: Three months since the purification. The theater is cleansed. Mr. Rollins understands now. He apologized tonight during Chinatown. Said he should never have betrayed cinema for profit. The Morrison children played in the lot before the show. I hear them laughing."

Kevin felt a chill despite the warming air. The purification. The fire that had killed nine people, described like it was a necessary ritual.

Lisa's voice came from the back of the booth: "There's a panel here."

Kevin turned. She was pointing at the ceiling—a square panel that didn't quite match the others, slightly offset.

"Crawlspace access," Nathan said.

Kevin dragged over a chair and climbed up, pushing the panel aside. His flashlight revealed a space above, maybe four feet high, extending over the booth. He pulled himself up.

The smell hit first. Not decay, but human habitation—sweat, dust, smoke. The crawlspace had been converted into living quarters. A sleeping bag lay in one corner, Coleman brand, relatively new. Stacked canned goods: beans, soup, vegetables. Some cans were rusted, labels faded—1970s stock. Others were recent, barcodes and modern packaging.

Water jugs lined one wall—five-gallon containers, three-quarters full. A camping stove, fuel canisters, spare clothing folded neatly. Personal items: a toothbrush, soap, a razor. Books about film history. A portable radio.

Someone lived here. Had been living here for years, maybe the full eleven since the fire.

"Nathan, get up here," Kevin called down.

Nathan climbed up, followed by Samantha. They stood crouched in the cramped space, surveying the living quarters with growing horror.

"This is recent," Kevin said, indicating the food. "Days old, not weeks. Someone's actively using this space."

Nathan was filming everything, his camera capturing the strange domesticity of it. A madman's studio apartment above a projection booth in a condemned drive-in.

Samantha found photographs. Polaroids tacked to the wall—self-portraits. The progression was disturbing. The first showed a man in his forties, gaunt but relatively healthy, wearing the remains of a projectionist's uniform. Each subsequent photo showed more deterioration. Wilder hair, more prominent ribs, sun-damaged skin. The uniform became rags.

The most recent photo looked recent—maybe weeks old. A skeletal figure with matted hair and beard, barely recognizable as human. But the eyes were sharp, aware, intense.

"Dalton Reed," Samantha said. "Age progression matches. This is him. He's alive, and he's been here the whole time."

A sound from below. Footsteps. Slow, deliberate, circling the booth.

Everyone froze. Kevin killed his flashlight and moved to the panel opening, looking down. The booth below was empty, door still ajar. But the footsteps continued outside, walking around the platform.

Not walking. Pacing. Like a predator circling.

Kevin's hand went to his belt, finding only the screwdriver. Not a weapon. Not against someone who'd survived alone in the desert for eleven years, who'd killed nine people and felt no remorse.

The footsteps stopped. Directly below the crawlspace. Kevin could hear breathing now—raspy, labored, like damaged lungs working hard.

A voice, low and rough from disuse: "You found my home."

Not a question. A statement. Someone speaking to the silence, knowing they'd hear even if they didn't answer.

"I saw you watching the show," the voice continued. "Did you enjoy it? Night of the Scarecrow. A classic. Under-appreciated. They don't make films like that anymore. Too commercial now. No artistry."

The voice was cultured underneath the roughness. Educated. The voice of someone who'd once been articulate, corroded by years of isolation.

"I have more," the voice said. "So many more to show you. The Godfather. Deliverance. The Poseidon Adventure. All the classics. The audience will be pleased. They've been waiting for new people. Fresh appreciation."

Silence. Then the footsteps resumed, moving away from the booth. Slow and measured, not hurrying.

Kevin waited two full minutes before speaking. "He's gone."

"We need to leave," Lisa whispered. She was shaking. "Now. Right now."

Kevin didn't argue. They descended from the crawlspace one at a time, dropping into the booth below. The door stood open, morning light streaming through. Outside, the lot was empty. No figure visible. But he was out there somewhere, watching.

They moved fast down the stairs and across the lot to the snack bar. Greg met them at the door, pale and frightened.

"I heard him," Greg said. "Talking to himself out there. Walking around the lot. Just... talking about movies like he was having a normal conversation."

Inside, Kevin locked the door and wedged the chair under the handle. Not that it would stop anyone determined, but it felt necessary.

"Dalton Reed is alive," Nathan said. "He's been living in that booth for eleven years. He thinks the people he killed are still here, still watching films. And last night he put on a show for us."

"Why?" Lisa asked. "What does he want?"

"An audience," Samantha said quietly. "He said it himself. The audience will be pleased. He's been playing films for ghosts. Now he has real people."

"And he's completely insane," Greg added. "Which means he's dangerous. We need to call the police."

"From where?" Kevin demanded. "Nearest phone is ten miles. One of us hikes out alone while the rest wait? Or we all go and abandon the equipment?"

"Abandon the equipment," Lisa said immediately.

"We're leaving," Kevin decided. "Together. Now. Leave the expensive gear, take the footage we've shot, get to the van, and drive. Once we're somewhere with phones, we call the police and report everything."

"The documentary—" Nathan started.

"Is over," Kevin interrupted. "We documented an abandoned drive-in. Mission accomplished. The rest—the film playing, the voices, the man living in the booth—we report to authorities and stay the hell away."

For once, Nathan didn't argue. They gathered the footage—film reels, Samantha's photographs, Greg's audio recordings. Left the cameras, the lights, the heavy equipment. Kevin didn't care. Equipment could be replaced.

They stepped outside into the rising sun. The desert was bright now, the screen towering against blue sky. Beautiful and terrible, a monument to something that had died and refused to stay buried.

The projection booth's windows watched them cross the lot.

Somewhere in the ruins, Dalton Reed was still there.

Still projecting films for an audience only he could see.

And now, he had five new viewers to entertain.
