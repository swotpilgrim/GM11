# Chapter 15: The Van is Sabotaged

Kevin reached the van first, moving with military efficiency despite the fear coiling in his gut. Their escape route. Their insurance policy. Their way out if Dalton's "invitation" turned into a trap.

It had to work.

The van sat in morning sun, metal already hot to the touch. Windows dusty, tires properly inflated, everything looking exactly as they'd left it. Kevin opened the driver's door while Nathan moved to the hood.

"Distributor cap's in place," Nathan confirmed, checking the engine. "Looks right."

"Try starting it," Kevin said.

Nathan slid into the driver's seat, turned the key.

The engine turned over. Once. Twice. Then died with a sputter.

Kevin's stomach dropped. "Again."

Nathan tried. Same result—starter engaging, engine trying to catch, then nothing. No sustained ignition. No rumble of life.

"Battery?" Lisa suggested, voice hopeful.

"Starter's working," Kevin said. He was already checking connections, testing wires, looking for obvious sabotage. Everything seemed intact. Distributor cap seated properly, spark plugs connected, battery cables tight.

Then he pulled the dipstick for the fuel tank.

Bone dry.

"No," Kevin breathed. The word came out quiet, disbelieving. Then louder as reality hit: "NO. Fucking NO!"

He climbed onto the roof rack with shaking hands, checked the jerry cans they'd strapped there yesterday in Tucson. Ten gallons of reserve fuel for the desert crossing. Insurance against running dry in the middle of nowhere.

Both cans empty. Completely drained. Not a drop left.

Kevin slammed his fist against the van's roof. Metal boomed. Pain shot up his arm. He didn't care. Rage and terror were warring in his chest, making it hard to breathe.

"What?" Greg called from below. "What's wrong?"

"He drained it." Kevin's voice shook. "The fuel tank. The reserve cans. Everything. While we were inside debating whether to trust him, he came out here and sabotaged our only way out."

Silence. Complete, terrible silence as the implications sank in.

Nathan climbed out of the driver's seat, face pale. "How much did we have?"

"Full tank—fifteen gallons. Plus ten in the cans." Kevin jumped down from the roof, landing hard. "Enough to get to Tucson and back twice over. He drained every single drop. Probably poured it into his own reserve or just dumped it. Doesn't matter. We're stranded."

"We hike," Greg said immediately. "Fuck the van. We walk to the highway. Ten miles, right? We can make that."

Kevin wanted to say yes. Wanted to believe it was that simple. But his tactical training wouldn't let him lie.

"Ten point three miles to the highway," he said. "In desert heat that'll hit ninety degrees by noon. We'd need a gallon of water per person minimum for a hike that long in these conditions. That's five gallons total." He gestured to their supplies visible through the van's windows. "We have exactly five gallons. No margin for error. And that's assuming everyone can make the distance."

He looked at Lisa—barely 110 pounds, already exhausted from her encounter with Dalton. At Greg—chain-smoking for twenty-four hours, out of shape from months of construction work and beer.

"We'd lose people," Kevin said flatly. "Dehydration, heat exhaustion, maybe worse. And even if the strongest made it to the highway, then what? Flag down a car, beg for help, send them back? That's hours. Maybe half a day. By the time help arrived..."

"We'd be dead," Lisa finished quietly. "Or Dalton would be gone. Disappeared back into the desert like he did in 1972."

Nathan was staring at the projection booth. "He planned this. From the moment we arrived, maybe before. Greg's grandfather knew this place. If he mentioned it to anyone, if word got around that someone was coming to film here... Dalton could have been preparing for days."

"The journal entry," Samantha said. "October 12th. 'Noticed movement near the entrance. Filmmakers perhaps.' He wrote that the day we arrived. He's been watching since we pulled up."

"And planning," Kevin added. "Disabling the van, studying our routines, learning our personalities. We're not guests. We're not even victims yet. We're prey. And he's been stalking us from the beginning."

Greg made a sound—half laugh, half sob. "I came here for two hundred dollars. Beer money to get through the semester. My roommate needed footage for his thesis. Now I'm going to die because you wanted to make a documentary about dead drive-ins."

He was looking at Nathan. They all were.

Nathan couldn't meet their eyes. Kevin was right. This was his fault. His obsession with capturing perfect footage, with telling the complete story, with staying just one more day. If they'd left yesterday like Kevin wanted, they'd be in Tucson now. Safe. Alive. Never knowing about Dalton Reed or his shrine or his eleven years of madness.

But they'd stayed. And now they were trapped.

"I'm sorry," Nathan said. The words felt pathetically inadequate. "You're right. All of you. I should have listened. We should have left yesterday."

"Apologies don't get us out of this," Kevin said. But his voice had lost some of its edge. Anger was pointless now. They needed solutions. "Options. Real options. What can we actually do?"

Samantha had her notebook out, thinking analytically despite the fear. "One: we attempt the hike as a group. High risk of casualties but possible. Two: we send the strongest—Kevin and Nathan—for help while the rest of us stay here. Splits the group, leaves three vulnerable. Three: we attend Dalton's screening and attempt negotiation. He wants validation, not necessarily death. Maybe we can give him what he needs and he lets us leave."

"Or four," Greg said darkly. "We wait. Someone will eventually notice we're missing. The university knows where we went. Your parents know, Nathan. Eventually someone sends help."

"Eventually could be days," Lisa said. "We told people we'd be gone through the weekend. It's Thursday. No one's expecting us back until Monday at earliest. That's four days."

"We don't have four days of supplies," Kevin said. "Water, maybe two days if we ration strictly. Food, three days. And that's assuming Dalton doesn't escalate. If he gets impatient, if he decides we're not cooperating..."

He didn't finish. Didn't need to. They all understood. Dalton Reed had burned nine people alive when they didn't respond the way he wanted. Eleven years of isolation hadn't made him less dangerous. If anything, it had refined his madness, given him time to perfect his methods.

"The screening," Nathan said. "We attend. We're filmmakers—we document everything. We show him respect, validate his work, make him feel understood. Then we negotiate. Ask permission to leave so we can tell others about what he's preserved. Appeal to his desire for recognition."

"And if he says no?" Greg demanded.

"Then we fight," Kevin said quietly. "Tire irons, wrenches, rocks, whatever we can use. Five against one. We're younger, healthier, fed and hydrated. He's been living on scavenged food for eleven years. We should have the advantage."

"Should," Lisa repeated. "But he knows this terrain perfectly. Knows where to hide, where to ambush, where we're vulnerable. Home ground advantage."

"And he's already killed nine people," Samantha added. "He has experience with violence. Most of us don't."

Kevin didn't mention that he did. Basic combat training, SERE school, two years in ROTC before switching to film school. But that was training. Not real violence. Not killing. He didn't know if he could actually hurt another person, even to save his friends.

They stood in the desert sun, reality settling over them like weight. Trapped twenty miles from help with a murderer who'd spent eleven years planning his perfect screening. No vehicle. Limited supplies. No good options.

"We vote," Nathan said finally. "One last time. Attempt the hike now despite the risks, or attend the screening tonight and try negotiation. Whatever we choose, we commit fully. No second-guessing."

The vote was quick. Greg wanted to hike—better to die trying to escape than passively walking into a trap. Lisa wanted to attend—they were already in Dalton's territory, might as well play by his rules until they found an opening. Samantha wanted to attend—for documentation, for understanding, for the slim chance negotiation might work.

Kevin abstained. "I'll follow the group decision. My tactical assessment says both options are high-risk. Hiking might kill us through attrition. Attending might kill us through Dalton. Pick your poison."

Nathan looked at his crew. Four faces watching him, waiting for his decision. His vote would break the tie.

He thought about his documentary. The footage they'd captured. Lisa's encounter with Dalton, the shrine, the journals. If they attended tonight, they'd document something unprecedented—a screening hosted by a man who'd lived eleven years in delusional isolation. The most important footage any of them would ever capture.

If they survived.

"We attend," Nathan said. "But we go in prepared. Armed. With clear exit strategies. We document everything. We play along with Dalton's fantasy until we find an opportunity. And if we can't negotiate our way out, we fight our way out."

No one cheered. No one argued. They simply nodded, accepting the decision because there were no better options.

"Six hours until sundown," Kevin said, checking his watch. "We use that time to prepare. Weapons, defensive positions, supply inventory, escape routes. We attend this screening, but we attend it ready for war."

They walked back to the snack bar together, leaving the useless van behind. Behind them, the projection booth sat on its concrete platform. Somewhere inside, Dalton Reed was preparing his masterpiece.

Threading film through ancient machinery. Arranging seats for an audience of fourteen. Making everything perfect for the screening he'd waited eleven years to host.

Nine dead victims who existed only in his delusions.

And five living captives who had no choice but to attend.

The sun climbed toward noon. Desert heat built. Six hours until sunset.

Six hours until the final screening.

And only Dalton Reed knew how it would end.
