# Chapter 15: The Van is Sabotaged

Kevin made one final check before they committed. Fifteen minutes until the screening, equipment gathered, defensive plan established. But he needed to confirm the van one more time. Their escape route. Their insurance policy.

"I'm checking the van," he announced. "Nathan, with me. Everyone else stay ready."

They crossed the lot quickly, sunset painting the desert in orange and gold. Beautiful and terrible, like everything about this place. The van sat where they'd left it, distributor cap in place, seemingly untouched.

Kevin opened the driver's door and turned the key.

The engine turned over. Once, twice. Then died.

He tried again. Same result—starter engaging, engine trying to catch, then nothing.

"Battery?" Nathan suggested.

"No, the starter's working." Kevin popped the hood, already knowing what he'd find but hoping he was wrong.

He pulled the dipstick for the fuel tank. Bone dry.

"Shit," he breathed. Then louder: "SHIT!"

He checked the jerry cans they'd strapped to the roof rack. Empty. Both of them, completely drained. He'd filled them in Tucson yesterday—ten gallons of reserve fuel. Gone.

Kevin slammed the hood and punched the van's side panel. Metal dented under his fist. Pain shot up his arm. He didn't care.

"He drained it," Kevin said, voice shaking with fury. "While we were preparing, while we were inside planning. He came out here and drained every drop of fuel."

"The screening," Nathan said quietly. "He wants to make sure we attend."

Kevin spun on him. "This is your fault. All of it. We could have left yesterday, but you had to stay for your fucking documentary. Now we're trapped."

"Kevin—"

"Don't." Kevin cut him off. "Don't justify it. Don't explain. We're twenty miles from civilization with no vehicle, no fuel, and a murderer who's decided we're his next victims. That's on you, Nathan. Your obsession put us here."

Nathan's face went pale, but he didn't argue. Because it was true.

Kevin forced himself to breathe, to think tactically despite the rage. Inventory their situation: Five people. Food for maybe two days if they rationed strictly. Water—he checked their supplies—five gallons total. In desert heat, they'd need a gallon per person per day minimum. One day of water.

Temperature forecast he'd heard on the truck stop radio yesterday: high of 90°F.

Distance to the highway: 10.3 miles.

"We could hike it," Kevin said. "Tonight, after dark when it's cooler. Ten miles, three hours at forced march pace. We'd be dehydrated by the end, but we'd make it."

"All of us?" Nathan asked.

Kevin thought about Lisa, barely 110 pounds, already exhausted from fear. Greg chain-smoking for twenty-four hours, out of shape from construction work and beer. "Maybe not all of us."

"Then we can't do it. We don't split up."

Kevin knew he was right. Splitting the group would be fatal. They'd survived this long by staying together.

"Options," he said, forcing his tactical mind to work. "One: we hike as a group, knowing some of us might not make it. Two: we send the strongest—me and you—for help while the others stay here. Three: we attend the screening and hope Dalton really does let us leave after."

"Or four," Nathan said quietly. "We fight. We take him down, search his supplies for fuel or vehicle access, force our way out."

"He's armed. We saw the revolver. And he knows this terrain perfectly. We'd be fighting on his ground, in his environment, against someone who's survived alone for eleven years. Tactically, we'd lose."

"So we're out of options."

"We're out of good options," Kevin corrected. "We have desperate options. Risky options. Options that might get us killed but might also get us out."

They returned to the snack bar. The others looked up hopefully, then saw their expressions.

"No fuel," Kevin reported. "Van's disabled. We're trapped."

Greg made a sound—half laugh, half sob. "I came here for two hundred dollars. Beer money to get me through the semester. Now I'm going to die because my roommate wanted footage for his thesis."

"We're not going to die," Kevin said, but the words rang hollow.

"We don't know that," Lisa said softly. "Dalton's been planning this. Since we arrived, maybe before. Everything's been leading to this screening."

"Then we give him what he wants," Samantha said. "We attend. We watch his film. We validate his delusion. We tell him it was beautiful, meaningful, worth preserving. Then we ask—politely, respectfully—if we can leave to tell others about his work."

"You really think that will work?" Greg demanded.

"I think it's our best chance. He needs validation from living people. If we give him that, maybe he lets us go."

"Or maybe he makes us permanent so we can never contradict the validation," Lisa countered.

Kevin looked at his watch. Ten minutes to sundown. Ten minutes to decide.

"We vote," he said. "Final vote. Hike tonight—risky, might lose people—or attend the screening—risky, might die there. Majority decides."

The vote was quick. Samantha for attending—anthropological documentation, best chance to survive through compliance. Nathan for attending—completion of the documentary, validation strategy. Lisa abstained—both options terrified her equally. Greg wanted to hike, damn the risks.

Kevin was the deciding vote again.

He thought about the desert at night. The darkness, the cold, the distance. Lisa collapsing from dehydration. Greg's smoker lungs giving out. And even if they made it to the highway, what then? Flag down a trucker at 2 AM and beg for help?

Or they could attend the screening. Armed, alert, together. Document everything. Look for opportunities. Play along with Dalton's fantasy until they found a way out.

"We attend," Kevin decided. "But we stay combat-ready. At the first sign of threat—fire, weapons, confinement—we fight our way out. Understood?"

Everyone nodded.

They gathered their equipment with mechanical precision, each movement deliberate despite the fear. Cameras, lights, audio recorder—the tools of documentary work that had brought them here. Kevin distributed the real tools: tire iron to himself, heavy flashlight to Nathan, wrench to Greg. Samantha had a pocket knife she'd carried since college, blade sharp enough to cut through rope or canvas. Lisa carried nothing—her hands wouldn't stop shaking, and Kevin didn't trust her not to drop a weapon.

"Stay together," Kevin ordered. "No one separates for any reason. If he tries to split us up, we refuse. That's non-negotiable."

They nodded, understanding. Divided, they were vulnerable. Together, they had a chance.

The sun touched the horizon as they walked toward the screen, boots crunching on gravel that hadn't felt human footsteps in over a decade. Five folding chairs sat in a careful arc, positioned for optimal viewing—Dalton had measured the angles perfectly, old projectionist instincts ensuring his audience would have the best experience. Behind them, speaker posts stood silent sentinel. And above, the projection booth waited, lit from within like a lighthouse guiding them to shore or to rocks.

Dalton appeared in the window, silhouetted against the light. He waved—a gracious host welcoming guests.

Kevin's hand tightened on the tire iron.

They reached the chairs. Sat down. Cameras rolling, recording everything. The desert air cooled rapidly, temperature dropping ten degrees in as many minutes.

The projection booth door opened. Dalton emerged, climbed down the stairs with careful dignity. He'd transformed himself for this—clean clothes, trimmed beard, an attempt at the professional projectionist he'd once been.

He stood before them, hands clasped, smiling.

"Thank you," he said, voice thick with emotion. "Thank you for coming. The audience has been waiting so long. Eleven years of showing films to grateful spirits. But tonight..." His smile widened. "Tonight we have real people. Living, breathing cinema lovers. This is the night I've dreamed of."

He looked at each of them in turn—Nathan with his camera, Samantha with her notebook, Kevin with his concealed weapon, Greg with his terror, Lisa with her tears.

"Tonight's film is very special," Dalton continued. "Chosen specifically for you. A meditation on preservation, loss, and the beautiful things we destroy. It will help you understand. Help you see why some things are worth dying for."

Kevin's blood went cold. Worth dying for. Not worth living for. Dying.

Dalton climbed back to the booth. A moment later, the projector's mechanism engaged. The beam shot out, hitting the massive screen.

Film leader countdown appeared. 5... 4... 3... 2...

A title card: "The Last Picture Show" (1971, Peter Bogdanovich)

Kevin knew that film. He'd seen it in film school. A story about a small-town movie theater closing, the end of an era, nostalgia for things that die.

Perfect choice for a man who'd killed to save a theater.

The film began. Black and white images filled the screen. The group sat in their chairs, cameras recording, documenting this impossible moment.

And behind them, Kevin heard it: the soft whisper of wind through speaker posts. But underneath, something else. Something that sounded like breathing. Like an audience settling in to watch.

He turned. The lot behind them was empty. Just speaker posts and shadows.

But the breathing continued. Multiple sources. Coming from nowhere and everywhere.

Dalton's ghost audience. Nine victims sitting in invisible cars, watching with them.

Kevin looked at the screen, at the projection booth, at his friends trapped in a madman's final screening.

They were committed now. No escape. No vehicle. No options except to watch and wait and hope.

The show had begun.

And only Dalton Reed knew how it would end.
