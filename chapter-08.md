# Chapter 8: Researching the Fire

Samantha spread her research across the floor like a crime board. Creating order from chaos steadied her hands, which had been shaking since Dalton Reed appeared by the van.

They'd barricaded themselves inside after that encounter. Kevin wedged the chair under the door, stacked equipment against it. Lisa watched from the window. Greg chain-smoked. Nathan reviewed footage.

And Samantha researched. Understanding was her weapon against fear.

"Walk me through the victims again," Nathan said. He had his notebook out, the documentarian needing facts. "Everything we know."

Samantha pulled out the main article—Arizona Daily Star, October 21, 1972. The photographs of the nine dead arranged like a memorial.

"The Morrison family," she began, touching the first photo. "David Morrison, thirty-four. Accountant for a construction firm. His wife Ellen, thirty-one, elementary school teacher. They'd been coming to the Stardust since it opened in '58. Friday night tradition."

She moved to the children's photos, feeling the familiar tightness in her chest. "Michael Morrison, eight years old. Third grade. Played Little League. Sarah Morrison, six. Loved drawing, according to her teacher. Tommy Morrison, three. Just... three."

The room was quiet except for Nathan's pen scratching.

"The kids were asleep in the back of the family station wagon," Samantha said. "The Morrisons parked center lot, row seven. The children were in sleeping bags—common back then, kids would sleep through the second feature."

"How did they die?" Kevin asked quietly.

"Smoke inhalation. Carbon monoxide. Never woke up." Samantha swallowed hard. "David Morrison tried to get them out. Found him in the driver's seat, door open, overcome before he could reach the back. Ellen was in the passenger seat."

Lisa made a soft sound of distress from the window.

Samantha moved to the next photos. "Roberto and Maria Delgado. Twenty-two and twenty-one. Married six months. This was their first date spot—they'd met at a screening of Love Story in 1970. Came back for their anniversary."

"Young," Nathan murmured.

"Very young." Samantha read their brief biographies from the obituaries. "Roberto worked at his father's restaurant. Maria was a nursing student. They were found outside their car—a 1969 Mustang—about fifteen feet from it. They tried to run."

She didn't elaborate on how they'd died. The photos from the fire scene, the ones she hadn't shown the group, told that story clearly enough. Burns and smoke, desperation and pain.

"Jack Rollins," she said, moving to the next photo. "Fifty-eight. Owner of the Stardust since 1961. Bought it from the original developer. His wife Barbara, fifty-six. They were in the snack bar office during the screening."

"Why were they there that late?" Kevin asked.

"End-of-week receipts. Friday night was the biggest night, they'd count the money and reconcile accounts. According to one employee interview..." Samantha found the clipping. "Jack always handled money personally. Didn't trust anyone else with it."

"Control issues," Nathan observed.

"Major control issues, from what I can tell. Multiple employees mentioned he micro-managed everything. Questioned every expense. Accused staff of theft regularly."

"Including Dalton?"

"Especially Dalton." Samantha pulled out another set of clippings. "But we'll get to that. The last victim was Timothy Walsh. Seventeen. Part-time employee, working concessions that night. He was covering the window when the fire started, serving customers during intermission."

"How did he die?" Lisa asked.

"Trying to help." Samantha found the witness statement. "Three different people reported seeing him running between cars, banging on windows to wake people up. He got at least two families out. Then the roof started collapsing and he was hit by debris. Smoke inhalation finished what the injuries started."

"A kid," Greg said bitterly. "Seventeen-year-old kid died being a hero."

Samantha laid out the timeline. "October 20, 1972. Friday night. The Godfather was first feature, started at 8:15. Deliverance was second, started around 10:30. Between films was intermission—about twenty minutes. That's when it happened."

She pulled out the fire marshal's report. "9:47 PM. Multiple witnesses saw flames in the projection booth windows. The booth was behind the screen, elevated platform. Once it caught, fire spread incredibly fast. The roof was tar paper over wood frame, basically kindling. Burning debris fell onto cars below."

"How many cars in the lot?" Kevin asked.

"Approximately eighty. Capacity was four hundred, so they were at twenty percent. Most people managed to evacuate—witnesses describe mass panic, cars trying to leave all at once, traffic jam at the exit. But some cars were blocked in. Some people were asleep. Some panicked and made bad decisions."

"And the booth?" Nathan prompted.

"Completely gutted. The projection equipment was destroyed, most of it melted. But the booth itself was concrete, so the structure survived. Fire marshal found evidence of accelerant—gasoline—at multiple points in the booth. Deliberately poured, deliberately ignited. They found a can—five-gallon jerry can—in the corner. Dalton's fingerprints."

"So definitely arson," Kevin said.

"No question. The fire was set intentionally, with gasoline, during the intermission when maximum people would be in their cars or at the concession stand. Maximum casualties."

Greg lit another cigarette. "Calculated mass murder."

"That's how it was treated. Police issued a warrant for Dalton Reed within hours. But he'd vanished."

Samantha pulled out the employee file she'd gotten from the library's archive—someone had donated the Stardust's business records years ago. Dalton Reed's employment application from 1965.

"Dalton Michael Reed. Born 1929, so he was forty-three in 1972. Previous employment: projection work in California—various theaters in Los Angeles, San Francisco. Film studies at UCLA, dropped out junior year. References described him as 'technically brilliant but temperamental.' Hired at the Stardust in August 1965 as assistant projectionist. Promoted to head projectionist in 1967."

"Seven years," Nathan calculated. "That's a long time in one job."

"For someone with his skill set, yes. He could have worked anywhere. Major theaters, studios, anywhere. But he stayed at a drive-in in the desert." Samantha found the newspaper article that had interviewed former employees. "Multiple sources describe him as obsessed with the work. Lived for the screenings. Spent hours maintaining equipment, cataloging films, ensuring perfect presentations."

"And Rollins?" Nathan asked.

"Treated him like shit." Samantha laid out the employee testimonies. "Margaret Chen, concession worker 1969-1972: 'Jack would scream at Dalton in front of customers if anything went wrong. Blamed him for broken equipment even though Jack refused to fund repairs.' Thomas Price, assistant projectionist 1966-1971: 'Jack paid Dalton below minimum wage, called it room and board even though Dalton didn't live on-site. When Dalton asked for a raise, Jack laughed at him.'"

"Exploitation," Kevin said.

"Systematic exploitation. According to tax records I found, Dalton was making $1.50 an hour in 1972. Minimum wage was $1.60. And he worked every screening—five nights a week plus weekend matinees. Should have been making overtime. Never did."

Greg was listening intently now. "My grandfather mentioned this. Said Dalton would come to the snack bar between films, eat day-old hot dogs because he couldn't afford meals. Said Rollins would laugh about it. 'My projectionist eats garbage,' like it was funny."

"Why did Dalton stay?" Lisa asked.

Samantha had wondered the same thing. "The film. I think he stayed for the film. Every testimony describes him as passionate about cinema. He built his whole identity around being a projectionist, serving the art form. For him, it wasn't just a job."

"So when Rollins threatened that..." Nathan started.

"Spring 1972." Samantha found the final piece. "Jack Rollins announced plans to convert to cheaper film stock, reduce screenings to weekends only, cut Dalton's salary further. Former employee Sarah Winters told police that Dalton 'looked like someone killed his dog' when Jack announced it. Said Dalton tried to argue that quality would suffer, that audiences deserved better. Jack told him audiences didn't care and if he didn't like it, he could leave."

"Pushed him to breaking," Kevin observed.

"Or gave him motive," Samantha countered. "Sympathizing with his situation doesn't excuse what he did. Nine people, Kevin. Three children. A teenager trying to save people. That's not a justified response to workplace abuse."

"I'm not justifying, I'm understanding. There's a difference."

Samantha knew he was right, but the photos of the victims made understanding feel like betrayal. She'd spent hours with these people's stories. The Morrison children's last day—Michael's Little League game, Sarah's drawing class, Tommy's third birthday party two weeks before. The Delgados' dreams of opening their own restaurant. Timothy Walsh's college acceptance letter.

Nine lives, ended because one man couldn't cope with his pain any other way.

"The manhunt," Nathan prompted.

"Massive. State police, county sheriffs, federal involvement because they thought he might cross into Mexico. They searched the desert for three weeks. Found nothing. No body, no evidence he'd died of exposure. No sightings at the border. He just... vanished."

"Until now," Greg said.

"Maybe." Samantha found the footnote she'd discovered in a 1982 retrospective article. "There were sightings. Unconfirmed, but consistent. 1975: scarecrow figure seen scavenging behind a Tucson grocery store at 3 AM. Security guard reported someone extremely thin, wild-haired, wearing rags. Chased him off, never got a clear look. 1977: break-in at a film supply warehouse. Nothing stolen except vintage film reels. 1978: university film library reported someone bypassing locks to access their archive. Again, only old films taken. 1980: multiple reports of someone living in the desert outside Tucson, seen at dawn and dusk, never approaching people."

"Same area," Kevin noted.

"Twenty miles radius. Never far from the Stardust. Like he couldn't leave."

"Or wouldn't," Nathan said. "This was his place. His theater. Why leave when he'd already sacrificed everything for it?"

"You're romanticizing a murderer," Lisa said quietly.

"No. I'm trying to understand him. Because if he's alive and he's been here all these years, we need to know what he's thinking. What he wants."

"He wants an audience," Samantha said. "That's what the logbook says. All those years playing films for ghosts. Now he has us."

The silence that followed was heavy with implication. Outside, the desert was fully bright now, the sun climbing. No sign of Dalton, but that meant nothing. He was out there somewhere, in the ruins he'd claimed as his kingdom.

Samantha gathered her notes, organizing them into chronological order. The fire, the victims, the manhunt, the sightings. A story of obsession and violence, delusion and survival.

"He's not going to let us leave," Greg said finally. "Is he? We're his audience now. Why would he let the show end?"

Nobody answered. Because they were all thinking the same thing.

Dalton Reed had lived in isolation for eleven years, maintaining a theater for ghosts.

Now he had real people to watch his films.

And the show had only just begun.
