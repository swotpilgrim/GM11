# Chapter 20: The Real Plan Revealed

The film ended with Venice dissolving into darkness, the final credits rolling across the massive screen. Nathan watched the light play across Dalton's face—rapture, satisfaction, the expression of someone who'd shared something sacred.

Then Dalton stood, and everything changed.

He applauded, slow and deliberate, each clap echoing across the empty lot. "Magnificent! What a perfect encapsulation of grief as ghost story, of the past bleeding into the present."

He turned to the darkness, to the speaker posts scattered across the cracked asphalt. "Did you feel it? The collective experience? This is what they took from us when they killed the drive-ins."

His voice rose, passion igniting into something harder.

"Communal dreaming. That's what cinema was meant to be. People gathering under the stars, experiencing art together, sharing emotional journey. Not isolated in their living rooms staring at tiny televisions. Not alone with their VCRs, consuming film like fast food."

Dalton paced now, gesturing to the ruins around them. "The industry murdered this. Murdered community. Murdered ritual. They chose profit over beauty, convenience over meaning."

Nathan kept filming, capturing the shift. The gracious host was evaporating, replaced by something rawer, angrier.

"I tried showing them." Dalton's voice dropped to something intimate and terrible. "That night in '72. The fire was symbolic—purification, rebirth. I thought if they saw the Stardust burn, if they understood what was being lost, they'd wake up. They'd fight to preserve what mattered."

"Nine people died," Kevin said flatly.

"Nine witnesses." Dalton turned to him, eyes bright. "Nine martyrs to a cause they didn't understand but came to embrace. Look at them now—eleven years later, still coming to screenings, still participating in cinema's sacred ritual. Death didn't end their love of film. It perfected it."

The delusion had shifted gear. This wasn't the gentle madness of talking to ghosts. This was ideology, justification, a narrative where mass murder became religious act.

Samantha leaned forward. "You think they wanted to die?"

"I think they understand now what I was trying to do. What had to be done." Dalton gestured to the empty lot. "Ask them yourselves. Frank Morrison tells me the fire was necessary. That someone had to take a stand against the death of cinema."

"Frank Morrison is dead," Greg said, his voice shaking. "They're all dead. You killed them."

"I freed them." Dalton's smile was beatific. "From mortality, from the mundane, from having to watch cinema die by corporate degrees. They exist now in the pure space between life and death, eternally present at the perfect drive-in, watching films forever."

Nathan's hand tightened on the camera. "What do you want from us?"

Dalton's attention snapped to him, focused and intense. "To witness. To document. You're filmmakers—you understand the power of image, of narrative, of showing the world truth they're too blind to see."

He walked to the projection booth, disappeared inside briefly, emerged carrying something. When he came closer, Nathan saw: film canisters. Three of them, stacked carefully.

"Tomorrow night," Dalton said, "I'm going to create my masterpiece. My final statement on what cinema means, what it's worth, what it demands from those who truly love it."

He set the canisters down gently, reverently.

"For eleven years I've maintained this temple. I've played films for the faithful nine, kept the ritual alive, refused to let the Stardust die. But everything must end eventually. Even worship. Even devotion." His voice softened. "Even me."

"What are you planning?" Samantha asked, though Nathan suspected they all knew.

"A final screening." Dalton's eyes gleamed. "The fire I started in '72 was accidental—it got away from me, spread faster than I intended. But this time it will be controlled. Deliberate. Perfect."

He gestured to the lot, the screen, the booth. "I'm going to burn it all. The Stardust's final show will be its own immolation. Cinema as funeral pyre. The complete marriage of form and content."

"And us?" Kevin's voice was hard.

"You'll film it." Dalton said it like it was obvious. "Your cameras will capture the Stardust's apotheosis. The faithful nine will watch one final time, and then we'll all ascend together. Your footage will survive—the only record of what true dedication to cinema looks like."

Nathan's blood turned cold. The plan crystallized with horrible clarity. Dalton intended to recreate the 1972 fire, but bigger, controlled, documented. A mass suicide disguised as artistic statement, with them as unwilling participants and chroniclers.

"We're not going to film our own deaths," Greg said.

Dalton tilted his head, confused. "Deaths? No, no. Transformation. Transcendence. You'll join the faithful nine in eternal appreciation of cinema. Your physical forms will burn, yes, but your essence—your understanding of what film means—that will persist forever."

"You're talking about murder-suicide," Kevin said. "That's what this is. Mass murder-suicide justified by film theory."

For a moment, fury flashed across Dalton's face. Then it smoothed out, back to gentle certainty.

"You don't understand yet. But you will. The faithful nine didn't understand at first either. They were afraid, tried to escape. But afterward, after the transition, they came back grateful. They thanked me for freeing them."

"They came back because you're delusional!" Greg stood, his chair scraping back. "There are no ghosts. No one's forgiving you. You're alone out here with your guilt and you've constructed this whole fantasy to avoid facing what you are—a murderer."

Dalton moved faster than Nathan expected. From his vest pocket, the revolver appeared—Smith & Wesson, nickel-plated, pointing directly at Greg's chest.

"Sit down." The theatrical voice was gone, replaced by something flat and final. "Please."

Greg sat.

Dalton kept the gun level, his hand steady despite his skeletal frame. "I understand your skepticism. The material world teaches us that death is the end, that there's nothing beyond. But you're wrong. The faithful nine are here. They speak to me every night. And tomorrow night, you'll speak to them directly."

"Put the gun down," Kevin said. "We can talk about this."

"We are talking about it." Dalton glanced at the weapon like he'd forgotten he was holding it. "Oh. This is just a precaution. I don't want anyone doing something foolish, like trying to run. You're safe here. Honored guests. But you need to stay for the final performance."

"We have a choice," Samantha said carefully. "You said we're guests, not prisoners."

Dalton's smile was sad. "You chose when you came to the Stardust. When you decided to document dying Americana, you chose to participate in its death. This is your documentary's natural conclusion."

He walked backward toward the snack bar, gun still trained on them. "I need to prepare for tomorrow's screening. You'll stay in the storage room tonight—it's secure, comfortable enough. In the morning we'll discuss the shot list. I want your footage to be perfect."

"We're not doing this," Nathan said.

"Yes, you are." Dalton's certainty was absolute. "Because if you don't, I'll burn it anyway. Tonight. Right now. With you trapped inside, unconscious from the smoke before you understand what's happening. No cameras, no documentation, no meaning. Just death."

He let that sink in.

"But if you cooperate, if you film the final screening properly, your work will survive. The footage will tell the world what cinema is worth. What twelve people—nine then, five now—sacrificed for art. Your names will be remembered as martyrs who understood what truly mattered."

The revolver never wavered. Behind Dalton, the projection booth glowed warm and inviting, the equipment still humming from the night's screening.

"On your feet," Dalton said gently. "Toward the snack bar. We'll get you settled for the night. Tomorrow will be a big day—we'll need to plan shots, choose camera angles, decide which films to screen during the fire. The faithful nine have suggestions, but I'd like your professional input."

Nathan stood slowly, the others following. Kevin's hand was on the tire iron, but Dalton saw it.

"Leave the weapons, please. You won't need them. No one's in danger until tomorrow night, and even then—it's not danger. It's apotheosis."

They walked toward the snack bar, Dalton herding them with the gun's gentle authority. The desert night stretched vast and indifferent around them, stars cold overhead, the highway twenty miles away across killing terrain.

Nathan's mind raced. They had until tomorrow night. Maybe eighteen hours. Time to find a weakness, to escape, to stop this before Dalton turned his delusion into inferno.

But first, they had to survive the night.

Dalton opened the storage room door—heavy steel, deadbolt on the outside. The room beyond was windowless concrete, maybe twelve by ten, empty except for some old boxes and a sleeping bag.

"I'm sorry it's not more comfortable," Dalton said. "But it's secure. You'll be safe here. The faithful nine used to help me move supplies through this room—they know it well. You won't be alone, even locked in."

Greg's breath hitched. The thought of spending the night in a locked room with imaginary ghosts pushed him toward panic.

"In you go." Dalton gestured with the gun. "I'll bring water and some food in a moment. Try to sleep. Tomorrow's screening requires everyone at their best."

They filed in one by one. Nathan last, still holding his camera. Dalton saw it and smiled.

"Keep it. Practice your shots. Think about composition. How will you frame the fire? What angles best capture transformation?"

The door swung shut. The deadbolt slid home with a sound like finality.

And in the darkness of the storage room, five film students sat with the knowledge that they had eighteen hours until Dalton Reed tried to burn them alive for art.

Nathan turned on his camera's LED light, casting harsh shadows across the concrete walls.

"We're getting out of here," Kevin said. "We're getting out, and we're stopping him."

"How?" Lisa's voice was small.

Kevin ran his hands along the walls, looking for weakness. "We find a way. There's always a way."

But in the vast desert night, with a gun-wielding madman between them and freedom, hope felt as thin and distant as the cold stars overhead.

Outside, they heard Dalton humming—theater organ music, bright and cheerful—as he prepared for tomorrow's final show.
