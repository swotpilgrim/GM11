# Chapter 27: The Footage

Samantha's motel room at the Desert Star Inn had become a makeshift editing suite. Nathan's camera connected to her laptop, Greg's audio recorder synced with the video files, three days of footage loaded and ready for review.

It was three days after the official report had been filed, one week since the fire. The five of them had gathered at Samantha's insistence—one final review of the material before deciding what to do with it.

"This feels wrong," Greg said from his position by the door, like he might bolt at any moment. "Watching ourselves almost die for... what? Film festival submissions?"

"For truth," Samantha said, clicking through files. "The official report gives the facts. This footage shows what it felt like."

Nathan wasn't sure he wanted to relive what it felt like. But Samantha had been persuasive: review it together, decide together, then move forward—either finishing the documentary or burying the material completely. Democratic decision.

She started playback.

The first hours were familiar—arrival, setup, atmospheric shots of decay. Nathan winced at his own voiceover narration, explaining how drive-ins represented a lost America, community gathering spaces replaced by isolated home viewing. The irony was painful now.

Then the strangeness began. Batteries dying despite full charges. Equipment malfunctions. The film playing itself.

"Pause there," Kevin said. Samantha stopped on a frame showing the projection booth lit up, beam hitting the screen, *Night of the Scarecrow* running with no visible operator.

"We need to talk about this," Kevin said. "Before we go further. How much of what happened was Dalton manipulating us versus... something else."

"You mean ghosts," Lisa said.

"I mean unexplained phenomena. Whether that's ghosts or atmospheric conditions or mass hallucination, I don't know. But this footage captures things that don't fit rational models."

Samantha pulled up Greg's audio files, loaded them into the editing software. The waveform visualization showed clear spikes during the screening of *Don't Look Now*—multiple voices layered over each other, distinct enough that audio processing software identified nine separate speakers.

"This is what my recorder captured during Dalton's conversation with the nine victims," Greg said. "Nine distinct voice signatures. I didn't doctor this. The equipment just... recorded what was there."

Samantha played it back. Underneath Dalton's voice and the film's audio, faint but unmistakable: crowd sounds. Murmured conversations. A woman's voice saying something in Spanish. A child's laughter. All of it barely audible but definitively present.

"Acoustic echo," Kevin said, but his voice lacked conviction. "Sound bouncing off speaker posts, creating phantom voices."

"For eleven years?" Lisa challenged. "Dalton talked to them every night for eleven years. You think echo patterns lasted that long?"

They watched more footage. Lisa's encounter with Dalton in the booth, his gentle madness on full display. The shrine to the nine victims—Nathan's camera had captured every detail. Newspaper clippings. Candles. Photos of the dead arranged like an altar.

Then Dalton speaking to empty air, having full conversations with people who weren't visible. The footage showed him listening, responding, reacting to comments only he could hear. Complete delusion or genuine communication? The camera couldn't determine.

"Here's the climactic section," Samantha said, loading the final files.

The screening of *Don't Look Now*. Dalton conversing with Mrs. Morrison about cinematography, offering the Delgados imaginary popcorn, asking Rollins's invisible presence about the restoration quality. The students watching, horrified fascination on their faces.

Nathan had forgotten he'd been filming almost constantly. His hands had held the camera on autopilot while his mind dealt with impossible situations. The result was comprehensive documentation of the surreal.

The footage showed Dalton's plan revealed. The gun produced. The imprisonment. Then—shaky, barely comprehensible—Nathan's camera recording from inside the burning booth as he grabbed projector components. Heat damage had created visual artifacts, warping the image, but you could still see the mechanical heart of Dalton's eleven-year obsession being ripped apart.

"And here," Samantha said quietly, advancing frame by frame. "This is what we need to discuss."

Dalton running into the fire. The booth collapsing. Standard documentation of a tragedy.

But in three specific frames, barely visible through smoke and heat distortion: nine shapes. Silhouettes arranged in rows like cars at a drive-in. The Morrison family in third row center. The Delgados to the left. Rollins in the back.

Samantha froze on the clearest frame. The shapes were transparent, could easily be smoke and heat creating pareidolia—human brains seeing patterns in randomness. Could be camera damage. Could be anything.

Or could be nine dead people watching Dalton Reed die in the fire he'd started, finally released from eleven years of his delusion.

"That's what the world will debate," Samantha said. "If you release this footage. Ghost hunters will call it proof. Skeptics will call it artifact. Everyone will have an opinion."

"What do you think it is?" Nathan asked.

She studied the image, analytical mind warring with experience. "I think... I think Dalton Reed believed so completely that nine people were there that he bent reality around his belief. Whether that created actual ghosts or just convinced us we saw ghosts, I don't know. But something happened at the Stardust that doesn't fit my rational model of the world."

Kevin zoomed in on the shapes, examining pixels. "These could be anything. Smoke, heat, damaged CCD sensor. There's no definitive proof."

"But there's no definitive disproof either," Lisa said. "That's the point. We were there. We felt them. Heard them. Whether you call that real or hallucination or shared trauma doesn't change the experience."

They watched the rest of the footage in silence. The fire spreading, the desperate fight, the escape. Nathan had kept filming even while running—shaky footage showed the burning Stardust from a distance, becoming a pillar of fire visible for miles.

The footage ended. Black screen. Finality.

"So what do we do with this?" Greg asked. "Bury it? Sell it? Make a documentary that argues one interpretation or another?"

Nathan had been thinking about this for a week. The documentarian in him saw a powerful story, festival-worthy material, career-making footage. But the human who'd lived it saw exploitation, voyeurism, trauma packaged as entertainment.

"We present it objectively," he said slowly. "No narration pushing ghosts or debunking them. Just chronological documentation: we arrived, this happened, this is what we experienced. Let audiences decide what they're seeing."

"That's intellectually cowardly," Kevin said. "You're passing the burden of interpretation to the viewer instead of taking a stance."

"Or it's intellectually honest," Samantha countered. "Acknowledging that some experiences resist simple explanation."

They debated for an hour. Kevin argued for a rational framing—mental illness and isolation explained everything. Lisa wanted acknowledgment of the supernatural elements. Greg wanted the footage destroyed entirely. Samantha pushed for ambiguity.

Nathan listened, weighing each perspective. Finally he made his decision.

"I'm going to edit this into a documentary. Chronological, minimal narration, focused on what happened rather than why. The title will be *The Last Screening*. Eighty-seven minutes, including the paranormal elements but not insisting on them. When it's done, I'll show it to you before submitting anywhere. We all have veto power—any one of us says no, it stays private."

Silence. Then, one by one, they nodded.

"Fair," Kevin said.

"I can live with that," Lisa agreed.

"Just don't make us look crazy," Greg said. "Show what happened, but don't make us look insane for living through it."

Nathan promised he wouldn't. Though he suspected that any documentary showing nine phantom audience members would make everyone involved look at least a little crazy. The trick would be making crazy look truthful.

Samantha burned copies of all the files onto DVDs—backup against loss, evidence preserved. She handed one to each of them.

"Whatever you decide, Nathan, we have the record. Even if *The Last Screening* never gets made, we'll always have proof we didn't imagine it."

Except the proof was as ambiguous as the experience. Audio that could be artifacts. Video that could be damage. Testimony that could be trauma. Nothing definitive, everything arguable.

Which was perhaps appropriate. The Stardust had always existed in liminal space—between past and present, cinema and reality, life and death. Why shouldn't its documentation exist in similar ambiguity?

They left the motel as evening fell. In two weeks, Nathan would return to classes, finish his senior year, graduate into an uncertain future. The documentary would take months to edit properly—hundreds of hours of work turning raw footage into narrative.

But as he drove back to campus, the DVDs on his passenger seat, Nathan knew he'd do it. Not for festivals or awards or career advancement. But because the story demanded to be told.

Dalton Reed had spent eleven years documenting screenings for ghosts, maintaining meticulous records of films shown and conversations had. Nathan would document Dalton's final screening, completing the record.

One projectionist's delusion captured by another's camera.

The desert night was clear, stars brilliant overhead. Somewhere in that darkness, the Stardust ruins cooled. Investigators had finished their work, removed Dalton's remains, catalogued evidence. Soon developers would bulldoze what was left.

But the footage would survive. The story would survive.

And whether nine ghosts still watched from speaker posts or whether the lot was just empty desert, Nathan would leave for audiences to decide.

Ambiguity was uncomfortable. But sometimes ambiguity was the only honest answer.

He drove through the Tucson night, headlights cutting through darkness, carrying footage of fire and ghosts and the terrible cost of loving cinema too much.

The last screening had been recorded.

Now came the hard part: figuring out what it meant.
