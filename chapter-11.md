# Chapter 11: Lisa's Exploration

Lisa woke to find Kevin and Nathan gone. Through the broken window she could see them crossing the lot—perimeter check, Kevin had mentioned before she'd dozed off. Samantha and Greg were asleep, exhausted from the long night.

Golden hour—that brief window when the rising sun painted everything in warm amber. Lisa had learned in film school that you couldn't fake golden hour, couldn't recreate it with filters or lights. You had to be there, camera ready, when it happened.

And it was happening now, outside, painting the ruins in colors that would never come again.

Her camera sat beside her, film already loaded. The mechanical Bolex that didn't rely on batteries, that worked through pure clockwork precision. She could be out and back in twenty minutes. Just capture the light, the textures, the way morning transformed decay into something beautiful.

Lisa stood, moving quietly to avoid waking the others. She grabbed her camera and slipped out the door.

The desert morning was cool still, temperature in the fifties. The light was extraordinary—low-angle sun catching the screen's peeling paint, making it glow. Speaker posts cast long shadows across the lot, creating geometric patterns of light and dark. Everything sharp and clear, the air so clean it felt like she could see for miles. This was why she'd become a cinematographer—moments like this, when light transformed the ordinary into art.

She filmed the screen first. Wide shot establishing the scale, then closer on the texture. The graffiti became abstract patterns in this light, the bullet holes like constellations scattered across a decaying sky. Beautiful and sad, ruins that had outlasted their purpose and found new meaning in abandonment.

The speaker posts next. She moved between them, filming how light caught the rust, the way metal degraded into lace. Each post different—some collapsed, some standing proud, all of them singing that low whistle as wind moved through.

She was halfway to the projection booth before she consciously decided to go there.

The booth sat on its platform, morning sun hitting it directly. The concrete glowed almost white, the broken windows creating dark geometric shapes against it. Visually striking—decay and light, shadow and exposure. She had to film it.

Lisa climbed the stairs, camera running. Through the viewfinder she framed the door, the rusted padlock hanging useless from the hasp Kevin had torn free. The door stood slightly ajar.

She should go back. Kevin and Nathan were across the lot, too far to help if something happened. But the light was streaming through the booth windows, creating shafts that illuminated floating dust. Like a church, she thought. Sacred light in a profane space.

Just a few shots inside. Document the space, the equipment, the way morning transformed it.

Lisa pushed the door open.

The projection booth was empty. The massive projector sat silent, carbon-arc mechanism cold. Film canisters lined the shelves, hand-labeled in meticulous script. Everything as they'd seen it before, but transformed by morning light streaming through the windows.

She filmed the projector, the way sun caught the lens, the geometric shadows the mechanism created. Then the shelves, the canisters—evidence of obsession, of decades maintaining this machinery for an audience only one man could see.

The crawlspace panel was open. Lisa noticed it now in the better light—a square opening in the ceiling, ladder rungs visible inside. Kevin had mentioned finding living quarters up there, but they'd descended quickly, spooked by footsteps outside.

Morning light poured down from gaps in the roof above. The crawlspace would be fully illuminated now. Perfect for filming.

She knew she should leave. Every instinct said this was dangerous, invasive, wrong. But her camera was running, and light like this didn't last.

Lisa climbed.

The crawlspace was larger than she'd expected from Kevin's description—maybe twenty feet long, eight feet wide. Low ceiling forcing her to crouch, but functional. Someone had converted it into living quarters with obsessive care.

A sleeping bag lay in one corner—Coleman brand, relatively new. Stacked canned goods lined one wall: beans, soup, vegetables. Some cans were rusted, labels faded from the 1970s. Others were recent, barcodes and modern packaging creating a timeline of survival.

Water jugs, a camping stove, spare clothing folded neatly. Personal items: a toothbrush, soap, a razor. Books about film history, their spines cracked from repeated reading. A portable radio.

Someone lived here. Had been living here for years.

But it was the shrine that stopped her breath.

Against the back wall, nine photographs were arranged in a careful arc. Newspaper clippings, faces cut from obituary pages and mounted on cardboard with meticulous care. The Morrison family: parents and three children, their faces frozen in happier times. The young Delgados, wedding photo smiles bright with hope. Jack and Barbara Rollins, formal portraits showing middle-aged respectability. Timothy Walsh, senior picture from high school, barely more than a boy.

The nine victims of the 1972 fire.

Each photo had a candle in front of it—white votive candles in glass holders. Recently lit. Lisa could see fresh wax drips, smell the faint smoke. Some had burned within the last day.

Her hands shook as she filmed. This wasn't just evidence of habitation. This was a shrine. Worship space. Memorial or trophy collection—she couldn't tell which.

Below the photos, offerings were arranged with the same obsessive precision. Film strips cut from reels, curled and faded with age. Ticket stubs from 1972, yellowed but carefully preserved. A small toy car—die-cast metal, scratched from play. A nursing textbook with "M. Delgado" written inside the cover.

Personal items. Things that might have belonged to the victims. Taken from the fire scene or from their lives before.

Lisa lowered the camera, feeling sick. This was wrong. Deeply, fundamentally wrong. She was violating something—not Dalton's privacy, but the victims' memory. Using their deaths for documentary footage.

She should leave. Right now.

But beside the shrine, she saw a leather journal. Thick, well-worn, the kind with a strap that wrapped around to keep it closed. Recently used—the leather was supple, not dried out.

Lisa picked it up with trembling hands.

The first entry was dated October 21, 1972. The day after the fire.

"They understand now. The purification was necessary. Cinema required sacrifice. Mr. Rollins sees that now. I hear him at night, speaking from the flames. 'You were right, Dalton. I was wrong. Art matters more than profit.' He forgives me. They all forgive me."

She flipped through pages, watching handwriting deteriorate from precise script to sprawling scrawl and back again. Months of entries, then years. All documenting the same delusion: conversations with the dead, screenings for ghosts, forgiveness from victims.

"January 14, 1973: Showed Chinatown tonight. The Morrison children laughed during the funny parts. They understand film better dead than most living people did. Death purified their appreciation."

"March 3, 1974: Mr. Rollins requested The Godfather again. I've shown it seventeen times now. He never tires of it. Says it's the last great film America produced. After this, only commerce and garbage."

Page after page. Year after year. A mind dissolving in isolation, reconstructing reality around a delusion that justified murder.

Lisa found entries from recent days. The handwriting had stabilized—still obsessive, but more controlled. Like someone who'd found equilibrium in madness.

"October 10, 1983: Wednesday evening showing: The Exorcist for the Morrison family. Little Sarah was frightened—I heard her crying. But Michael told her it's only a movie, explained the special effects. Such a bright boy. They've learned so much."

"October 12, 1983: Noticed movement near the entrance. Travelers? Urban explorers? They have equipment—cameras, lights. Filmmakers perhaps. Real people for the first time in so long. The audience is excited. They ask if I'll play something special. I tell them yes. Soon."

Lisa's hands went numb. October 12th. The day they arrived.

She flipped to the most recent entry. October 13, 1983. Yesterday.

"New visitors. Young cinema lovers. I can tell by how they handle equipment, how they frame shots. They understand film language. The audience insists I welcome them properly. 'Show them your collection, Dalton. Share what you've preserved. Let them see what dedication means.' Finally, real people who might appreciate the work. Real eyes to see the screenings. The audience has been patient so long. Now they're rewarded. Five new members."

Five new members.

Not audience members. Members. Like the Morrison family were members. Like the Delgados were members.

Five new dead people.

Lisa set down the journal carefully, hands trembling. The implications were undeniable. Dalton Reed had watched them arrive, catalogued them, decided they would complete his audience. Fourteen souls bound to this place—nine who died in 1972, five who would join them.

She looked at the shrine again. Nine faces frozen in photographs, candles burning, offerings arranged with obsessive devotion. The Morrison children would never grow up. The young Delgados would never celebrate an anniversary. All of them trapped here in Dalton's delusion, forced to watch movies for eternity while he talked to their ghosts.

And he wanted to add her. Add Nathan, Kevin, Samantha, Greg. Complete his audience with fresh victims who understood cinema the way he did.

Lisa picked up her camera with shaking hands. She needed to document this. All of it. The shrine, the journals, the evidence of eleven years of madness. If something happened to them, someone needed to know the truth.

She filmed the photographs one by one, zooming in on each face. The Morrison family—parents in their forties, children aged seven, nine, and eleven. The Delgados—newlyweds, maybe twenty-five. Jack and Barbara Rollins—the owner and his wife, middle-aged and respectable-looking. Timothy Walsh—just a teenager, probably worked the snack bar.

Nine people who came to see a movie and never left.

The candles flickered in some unfelt breeze. Lisa lowered the camera, suddenly aware of how isolated she was. Up in a crawlspace in an abandoned building, surrounded by a shrine to murder victims, reading the journals of the man who killed them.

She needed to leave. Now. Get back to the others, show them the journal, convince them to abandon the documentary and run.

But the light was so perfect up here. The morning sun streaming through gaps in the roof, illuminating the dust, making even this macabre shrine beautiful in its own terrible way. And she was a cinematographer. This was what she did—found beauty in darkness, meaning in decay.

She took one more shot. Wide angle, capturing the entire shrine. The nine faces watching her. The candles burning. The offerings laid out like prayers.

The camera's shutter clicked.

And in the silence that followed, Lisa heard something that made her blood freeze.

Breathing.

Not her own. Coming from somewhere else in the crawlspace. Slow, steady breaths in the darkness beyond the shrine.

She wasn't alone up here.

She'd never been alone.
