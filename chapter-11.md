# Chapter 11: Lisa's Exploration

Lisa woke to find Kevin and Nathan gone. Through the broken window she could see them crossing the lot—perimeter check, Kevin had mentioned before she'd dozed off. Samantha and Greg were asleep, exhausted from the long night.

She should stay inside. That was the smart thing, the safe thing. Stay with the group, maintain watch, wait for Kevin and Nathan to return.

But the light was perfect.

Golden hour—that brief window when the rising sun painted everything in warm amber. Lisa had learned in film school that you couldn't fake golden hour, couldn't recreate it with filters or lights. You had to be there, camera ready, when it happened.

And it was happening now, outside, painting the ruins in colors that would never come again.

Her camera sat beside her, film already loaded. The mechanical Bolex that didn't rely on batteries, that worked through pure clockwork precision. She could be out and back in twenty minutes. Just capture the light, the textures, the way morning transformed decay into something beautiful.

Lisa stood, moving quietly to avoid waking the others. She grabbed her camera and slipped out the door.

The desert morning was cool still, temperature in the fifties. The light was extraordinary—low-angle sun catching the screen's peeling paint, making it glow. Speaker posts cast long shadows across the lot, creating geometric patterns of light and dark. Everything sharp and clear, the air so clean it felt like she could see for miles. This was why she'd become a cinematographer—moments like this, when light transformed the ordinary into art.

She filmed the screen first. Wide shot establishing the scale, then closer on the texture. The graffiti became abstract patterns in this light, the bullet holes like constellations scattered across a decaying sky. Beautiful and sad, ruins that had outlasted their purpose and found new meaning in abandonment.

The speaker posts next. She moved between them, filming how light caught the rust, the way metal degraded into lace. Each post different—some collapsed, some standing proud, all of them singing that low whistle as wind moved through.

She was halfway to the projection booth before she consciously decided to go there.

The booth sat on its platform, morning sun hitting it directly. The concrete glowed almost white, the broken windows creating dark geometric shapes against it. Visually striking—decay and light, shadow and exposure. She had to film it.

Lisa climbed the stairs, camera running. Through the viewfinder she framed the door, the rusted padlock hanging useless from the hasp Kevin had torn free. The door stood slightly ajar.

She should go back. Kevin and Nathan were across the lot, too far to help if something happened. But the light was streaming through the booth windows, creating shafts of illuminated dust. Cinematic. Perfect.

Just a few shots inside. Document the space, the equipment, the way light transformed it.

Lisa pushed the door open.

The projection booth was empty. The massive projector sat silent, carbon-arc mechanism cold. Film canisters lined the shelves, hand-labeled in meticulous script. Everything as they'd seen it before, but transformed by morning light.

She filmed the projector, the way sun caught the lens, the geometric shadows the mechanism created. Then the shelves, the canisters—evidence of obsession, of decades maintaining this machinery.

The crawlspace panel was open. Lisa hadn't noticed it before in the darkness, but now she could see the square opening in the ceiling, ladder rungs visible inside.

She knew she should leave. This was Dalton's private space, his sanctuary. Entering it felt like violation.

But her camera was running, and light was pouring down from gaps in the roof above. Artist's eye overrode common sense.

Lisa climbed.

The crawlspace was larger than she'd expected—maybe twenty feet long, eight feet wide. Low ceiling, she had to stay crouched. But the light... morning sun streamed through gaps in the roof boards, creating shafts that illuminated floating dust. Like a church, she thought. Sacred light in a profane space.

Then she saw the shrine.

Against the back wall, nine photographs were arranged in a careful arc. Newspaper clippings, faces cut from obituary pages. The Morrison family: parents and three children, their faces frozen in happier times. The young Delgados, wedding photo smiles. Jack and Barbara Rollins, formal portraits. Timothy Walsh, senior picture from high school.

The nine victims of the 1972 fire.

Each photo had a candle in front of it—white votive candles in glass holders. Recently lit, from the wax drips. Fresh. Some burned within the last day.

Lisa's hands shook as she filmed. This wasn't just evidence of someone living here. This was a shrine. Worship space. Memorial to the dead.

Or something darker.

Below the photos, offerings were arranged with obsessive precision. Film strips cut from reels, curled and faded. Ticket stubs from 1972, yellowed but carefully preserved. A child's toy car—Michael Morrison's, she thought, remembering Samantha's research. A nursing textbook—Maria Delgado's.

Personal items. Things taken from the victims.

Lisa felt sick. This wasn't memorial. This was trophy collection. Evidence of obsession that had lasted eleven years.

She filmed it all, hands trembling, forcing herself to document. The camera created distance—lens between her and horror, making it bearable through mediation.

A leather journal sat beside the shrine. Lisa set down the camera and picked it up with shaking hands.

The first entry was dated October 21, 1972. The day after the fire.

"They understand now. The purification was necessary. Cinema required sacrifice. Mr. Rollins sees that. I hear him at night, speaking from the flames. 'You were right, Dalton. I was wrong. Art matters more than profit.' He forgives me. They all forgive me."

Lisa flipped through pages, watching handwriting deteriorate from precise script to sprawling scrawl and back again. Months of entries, then years. All documenting the same delusion: conversations with the dead, screenings for ghosts, forgiveness from victims.

"January 14, 1973: Showed Chinatown tonight. The Morrison children laughed during the funny parts. They understand film better dead than most living people did. Death purified their appreciation."

"March 3, 1974: Mr. Rollins requested The Godfather again. I've shown it seventeen times now. He never tires of it. Says it's the last great film America produced. After this, only commerce and garbage."

"July 19, 1975: Saw a woman in town today. She looked at me with disgust. The living don't understand. They consume cinema like fast food, waste it on multiplexes and television. My audience is pure. Dedicated. Eternal."

Page after page. Year after year. A mind dissolving in isolation, reconstructing reality around a delusion that justified murder.

Lisa found the recent entries. The handwriting had stabilized—still obsessive, but more controlled. Like someone who'd found equilibrium in madness.

"October 10, 1983: Wednesday evening showing: The Exorcist for the Morrison family. Little Sarah was frightened—I heard her crying. But Michael told her it's only a movie, explained the special effects. Such a bright boy. They all love horror films now. Death taught them that fear can be entertainment."

"October 12, 1983: Noticed movement near the entrance. Travelers? Urban explorers? They have equipment—cameras, lights. Filmmakers perhaps. Real people for the first time in so long. The audience is excited. They ask if I'll play something special. I tell them yes. Soon."

"October 13, 1983: New visitors. Young cinema lovers. I can tell by how they handle equipment, how they frame shots. They understand film language. The audience insists I welcome them properly. 'Show them your collection, Dalton. Share what you've preserved. Let them see what dedication means.' Finally, real people who might appreciate the work. Real eyes to see the screenings. The audience has been patient so long. Now they're rewarded. Five new members."

Lisa's breath caught. Five new members. The phrasing was wrong. Not five new audience members. Five new members of the audience.

Five new dead people.

The journal fell from her hands. She grabbed her camera and scrambled toward the ladder, terror overriding everything.

Behind her, a sound. Slow breathing. Rough and labored, like damaged lungs working hard.

Lisa spun. The crawlspace was empty. But she could hear it clearly now—breathing from below, in the booth.

Someone had entered while she read.

Someone was standing between her and the ladder.

She forced herself to move to the opening, look down. The booth below was still empty. Projector silent, door ajar exactly as she'd left it.

But the breathing continued. Close. Like it was right next to her in the crawlspace.

Lisa's rational mind said it was wind through the roof gaps, acoustic tricks, her own panicked gasps. But her body knew better. Every instinct screamed danger.

She descended the ladder fast, hands sliding on rungs, camera banging against her chest. Hit the booth floor and ran for the door.

Outside, she nearly collided with Kevin and Nathan returning from their perimeter check.

"Lisa!" Nathan grabbed her arms. "What were you doing in there?"

She couldn't speak. Could only shake, camera clutched tight, the images she'd filmed branded into her memory.

The shrine. The journal. Five new members.

Dalton Reed wasn't just watching them.

He was collecting them.

For his eternal audience.
