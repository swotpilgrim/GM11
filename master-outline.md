# THE DRIVE-IN THEATER - Master Outline

## CHAPTER 1: ARRIVAL AT THE STARDUST
**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Film students arrive at abandoned Stardust Drive-In, October 1983. Massive screen dominates desert, speaker posts like tombstones. Nathan sees tragic beauty, Greg voices grandfather's warnings. Survey ruins: boarded snack bar, gutted booth, skeletal playground. Fence cut by trespassers. Unload equipment as sunset deepens. Nathan's documentary romanticism clashes with Greg's desire to leave. Kevin's pragmatism, Samantha's research obsession, Lisa's unease established. Set base camp in snack bar back room as darkness falls.

**Tone:** Atmospheric establishing, melancholic Americana, building unease

## CHAPTER 2: SETTING UP CAMP
**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Kevin rigs lights and generator. Nathan explains documentary vision: preserving drive-in culture's death. Samantha shares 1972 fire research—nine deaths, arson, projectionist Dalton Reed vanished. Greg's audio picks up interference. Lisa films golden hour light. Character dynamics: Nathan/Samantha chemistry, Kevin's skepticism versus romanticism, Greg's nervous energy. Plan night shoot over beers. Desert silence grows oppressive, temperature drops. Nervous anticipation builds. Greg shares grandfather's stories about Dalton's disturbing obsession.

**Tone:** Character establishment, documentary procedural, creeping atmosphere

## CHAPTER 3: FIRST SHOOT
**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Night filming begins. Nathan directs shots: screen, speaker posts, playground. Kevin operates sound, captures wind through metal. Lisa films textures—peeling paint, rust, glass. Samantha explores snack bar, finds 1972 menus and posters. Greg's audio captures unexplained sounds: faint music, voices. Kevin dismisses as acoustic tricks. Nathan stages atmospheric shots. Lisa feels watched but sees nothing. Discussion of Dalton Reed—obsessed projectionist exploited by owner. Projection booth looms dark. Decision: explore it next.

**Tone:** Documentary atmosphere, establishing normalcy before disruption, subtle wrongness

## CHAPTER 4: EQUIPMENT FAILURES
**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Approaching projection booth, equipment malfunctions begin. Camera batteries drain despite full charges. Kevin's audio recorder warbles. Flashlights die. Return to camp for backups—same problems. Kevin frustrated, blaming cheap batteries. Switch to manual Bolex and fresh cells. Booth's padlock rusted but door ajar. Inside: dust, smoke smell, old film odor. Projection equipment surprisingly intact—1970s carbon-arc projector, stacked reels. Samantha identifies rare prints. Lisa overwhelmed with dread. Greg's recorder captures clear voice: "Get out." Kevin argues it's playback artifact. But recording hadn't been running.

**Tone:** Technical mystery, rationality versus intuition, tension rising

## CHAPTER 5: THE FILM PLAYS
**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Reviewing footage at camp, projection booth suddenly lights up. Projector running, film playing on screen: "Night of the Scarecrow," 1971 horror movie. Clear picture, sound through dead speakers. Impossible. Kevin sprints to booth—locked from inside. Pounds on door. Film continues playing. Nathan films the screen, terrified and amazed. Samantha recognizes rare uncut print. Greg panics—need to leave. Lisa sees shadow move in booth window, blocking projection light briefly. After ten minutes, film stops. Booth goes dark. Silence. They regroup, shaken. Someone is here. Someone still running shows.

**Tone:** Escalation to impossible, wonder and fear, point of no return

## CHAPTER 6: INVESTIGATING THE BOOTH
**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Kevin forces booth door—now unlocked, inviting. Projector still warm, film threaded ready. But no power connected—generator cables cut years ago. Kevin finds hidden jury-rigged battery system in wall. Someone maintains this equipment. Samantha discovers logbook: screening schedules 1972-1983, obsessive handwriting, films "played for the audience." Recent entry: October 12, 1983. Lisa finds concealed crawlspace panel above ceiling. Greg refuses to climb up. Nathan and Kevin investigate with flashlights: living space with sleeping bag, canned food, water jugs, personal belongings. Someone lives here. Hasty retreat, realizing they're not alone.

**Tone:** Discovery and dread, evidence accumulating, danger becoming real

## CHAPTER 7: THE DECISION TO STAY
**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Group debates leaving versus staying. Greg demands immediate departure. Kevin agrees it's unsafe. Nathan sees documentary opportunity: incredible story if it's Dalton Reed. Samantha hooked: someone living here eleven years. Lisa torn between terror and curiosity. Nathan persuades: stay until dawn, document, leave at first light. Talk if encountered, don't confront. Greg agrees reluctantly—stay together, keep van keys accessible. Review footage: gaunt figure appears in multiple backgrounds, different positions, watching. Never in focus, always peripheral. Didn't notice while shooting. Now clear: stalked since arrival.

**Tone:** Group conflict, commitment despite fear, stakes clarified, Act 1 culmination

## CHAPTER 8: RESEARCHING THE FIRE
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Barricaded in back room, research 1972 fire using Samantha's clippings. Nine victims: Morrison family (five), Delgado couple, owner Jack Rollins and wife, teen employee. Fire started in booth during double-feature, spread to lot. Smoke and burn deaths. Dalton Reed vanished. Evidence indicated arson: accelerant, deliberately set. Theory: Dalton set fire after wage theft and humiliation, fled to Mexico. Body never found, case cold by 1974. Samantha finds rumors: some thought Dalton died in desert, others reported sightings scavenging Tucson. Greg's grandfather knew Dalton—brilliant but unhinged, worshipped cinema religiously.

**Tone:** Investigative, historical piecing-together, villain backstory emerging

## CHAPTER 9: REVIEWING THE FOOTAGE
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Kevin reviews footage systematically, logging stalker appearances. Fourteen shots across three hours. Always watching, never approaching. In one shot, he's in booth window while they filmed playground—impossible travel time. Timeline shows figure tracking through hidden paths. Samantha notes clothing: dark, ragged, rough living. Nathan observes body language: curious, proprietary, not threatening. Lisa's chilling observation: several shots show figure where they should've seen him—but didn't. Only camera captured him. Greg's audio contains whispers: "My theater... my audience... stay for the show." Deeply disturbed individual.

**Tone:** Analytical, pattern recognition, threat assessment, digital forensics

## CHAPTER 10: PERIMETER CHECK
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Kevin and Nathan check perimeter at dawn. Find evidence everywhere: footprints circling van, equipment moved slightly, fresh scratches. Someone walked among them during night. Van's distributor cap removed—can't start engine. Kevin finds it hidden under snack bar steps: not destroyed, just hidden to strand them. Message: you're not leaving yet. Discover Dalton's other hiding spots: dugout under screen foundation with supplies, false floor in storage room with film canisters and parts. Eleven years creating warren of tunnels and caches. He knows every inch—they're in his territory. Argue: Kevin wants to hike for help, Nathan wants to confront on camera. Kevin reluctantly waits.

**Tone:** Tactical assessment, realization of being trapped, male conflict over approach

## CHAPTER 11: LISA'S EXPLORATION
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Lisa wakes early, Nathan and Kevin gone. Takes camera out alone at sunrise—bad decision driven by artistic vision. Films speaker posts with golden light, screen texture, decay's beauty. Enters booth alone, drawn by morning light. Climbs to crawlspace, goes deeper: discovers Dalton's living space. Shrine to nine victims—newspaper photos with candles. Fresh candles, recently lit. Stacked canned food. Leather journal with entries: "October 10, 1983 - The Exorcist for the Morrison family. They loved it. I heard their applause." Delusional entries describing screenings for ghost audiences. Most recent: "New visitors. Young people who love cinema. Finally, real audience again."

**Tone:** Atmospheric exploration, terrible discovery, violation of sanctuary, mounting horror

## CHAPTER 12: THE SHRINE
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Lisa documents shrine, horrified but compelled. Journals dating to 1972. First entries coherent: Dalton's rage at Rollins, plan to "punish the owner who killed cinema." Then fire. Desert hiding. Return: "They're still here. I hear them calling. They forgive me. The show must go on." Eleven years deteriorating sanity in obsessive handwriting. Recent entries: maintaining projector, stealing supplies, playing films nightly for "the faithful nine." He converses with them, seeks approval. Photos: Dalton before fire (clean-cut, intense), recent timer-photo (gaunt, wild, unrecognizable). Hears footsteps below. Trapped in crawlspace. Voice, soft, theatrical: "You found my home. Like films?"

**Tone:** Claustrophobic terror, psychological profile revealed, direct confrontation imminent

## CHAPTER 13: DALTON REVEALS HIMSELF
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Lisa frozen. Voice continues, cultured but strained: "I saw you filming. Artist's eye. You understand what's been lost." Speaking through crawlspace opening, not threatening, pleading. "This was a cathedral. Rollins killed it with greed. I tried saving it." Lisa asks what he wants. "To show you. To have an audience. Real people who appreciate cinema." His hand on ladder: filthy, missing two fingers. "Come down. Let me show my collection." Lisa says friends coming. "I know. I've been watching. Tall one thinks I'm equipment failure. Nervous one wants to run. But you and notebook people—you understand." Withdraws. "Tonight. Special screening. Be my guests." Disappears.

**Tone:** Psychological tension, villain's twisted logic revealed, false civility masking danger

## CHAPTER 14: REGROUPING
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Lisa escapes booth, finds others panicking over her absence. Tells everything: shrine, journals, Dalton speaking. Kevin furious—she could've been killed. Greg wants immediate evacuation. Nathan asks what Dalton said. Lisa repeats invitation: tonight's screening. Samantha, despite fear, fascinated: projectionist living in delusion eleven years, playing films for ghosts. Nathan proposes filming Dalton, then leaving. Kevin vetoes: too dangerous. Arsonist and murderer. Walk to highway now. Group splits: Nathan and Samantha want documentary, Kevin and Greg want escape, Lisa paralyzed. Compromise: fix van first, recover distributor cap. If impossible, document one screening, hike out dawn.

**Tone:** Group fracturing, debate over risk versus reward, priorities in conflict

## CHAPTER 15: THE VAN IS SABOTAGED
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Kevin and Nathan retrieve distributor cap, attempt starting van. Engine turns but dies. Kevin checks fuel tank: drained. Dalton siphoned gas during night. Fully stranded twenty miles from highway. Kevin rages, punches van. This isn't documentary subject—hostage situation. Greg breaks down: grandfather warned him, came for beer money, now trapped with murderer. Samantha rationalizes: Dalton hasn't hurt them, just wants audience. Maybe indulge delusion, then he releases them. Lisa counters: he killed nine people, won't let witnesses go. Nathan realizes his obsession led them here. Inventory supplies: limited food, water for two days, film stock, batteries. No weapons except tools. Nearest help: ten-mile hike. Wait until nightfall, attend screening, attempt escape during night.

**Tone:** Desperation, consequences of choices, survival planning, midpoint crisis

## CHAPTER 16: DALTON'S PHANTOM AUDIENCE
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Late afternoon. Projection booth comes alive: equipment sounds, reels threading, machinery warming. Greg's audio captures impossible sounds: multiple voices, laughter, conversation—arriving audience. No one there. Booth window glows. Projector beam hits screen. Title card: "Tonight's Feature: Targets, 1968, Peter Bogdanovich." Film begins. Through binoculars, Nathan sees Dalton working projector, talking animatedly to empty air. Greeting invisible patrons, gesturing to invisible seats, completely immersed. Samantha recognizes film's significance: mass shooter at drive-in. Dalton sending message. Film plays two hours. Group watches, unnerved. When it ends, Dalton's voice through speaker system: "Tonight at sundown. Special screening. My honored guests will attend."

**Tone:** Surreal horror, delusion made visible, symbolic threat, dread building

## CHAPTER 17: PREPARING FOR CONFRONTATION
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Group prepares for night. Kevin fashions weapons: tire iron, broken speaker post, tools. Nathan insists on bringing cameras—document whatever happens. Samantha packs journals as evidence. Lisa nearly catatonic with fear. Greg keeps watch, chain-smoking. Discuss strategy: attend screening together, humor Dalton, watch for escape opportunities. Kevin argues for fighting out. Nathan insists on talking—Dalton is mentally ill, not evil. Samantha: film fanatics respond to cinema language. Earn trust through shared passion, then run. Sunset approaches. Dalton emerges from booth in daylight for first time: skeletal, wild-haired, projectionist uniform rags. Walks through speaker rows arranging invisible cars, pantomiming greetings. Setting up for full house. Looks directly at camp and waves. Showtime.

**Tone:** Siege preparation, strategy and conflict, villain in full view, inevitable confrontation

## CHAPTER 18: THE SCREENING BEGINS
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Sundown. Group walks toward screen. Dalton set up folding chairs by concession stand. Cleaned himself, slicked hair, playing gracious host. "Welcome! Full house tonight." Gestures to empty spaces, introducing invisible patrons. "The Morrisons are here, the Delgados—never miss a show. Mr. Rollins sends regards from back row." Theatrical announcer voice, cultured. Nathan engages: asks about collection, years here. Dalton beams, describing prints, preservation efforts, keeping cinema alive in this temple. Samantha asks about fire. Expression darkens. "Tragedy. Necessary tragedy. Rollins killed art for profit. Someone had to take a stand." Escorts them to seats. Booth lights up. Film begins: "Don't Look Now," 1973. Dalton sits with them, narrating trivia, quoting reviews.

**Tone:** Disturbing civility, madman's hospitality, performance of normalcy over violence

## CHAPTER 19: TALKING TO GHOSTS
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

During screening, Dalton converses with invisible audience. Laughs at jokes no one made, shushes empty air, responds to comments only he hears. "Yes, Mrs. Morrison, the cinematography is extraordinary—Venice as character, not setting." Offers imaginary popcorn. Students watch, horrified and fascinated, as delusion plays out real-time. Turns to Nathan: "Your friend in back agrees—American cinema peaked in seventies. After that, corporate greed." Nathan asks who agrees. "Mr. Rollins. He understands now what he destroyed. Eleven years apologizing every night." Kevin whispers they need to leave. Dalton hears: "Leaving? But we're at midpoint! Best part coming." Tone shifts, harder. "The audience wants you to stay. They've been waiting. You can't disappoint them."

**Tone:** Psychological horror, delusion witnessed, threat beneath courtesy, trap closing

## CHAPTER 20: THE REAL PLAN REVEALED
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Film ends. Dalton stands, applauding, encouraging invisible others. Turns to students, expression rapturous. "Did you feel it? Collective experience? This is what they took from us. Communal dreaming. Now everyone watches alone on tiny televisions. They murdered this." Paces, agitated. "I tried to show them that night in '72. Fire was symbolic—purification, rebirth. But they called it murder. They don't understand art requires sacrifice." Samantha carefully asks what he wants. Dalton smiles. "To witness. Document. You're filmmakers—you'll understand. Tomorrow night, my masterpiece. My final show. You'll film it, show the world what cinema means. What it's worth dying for." Greg stands to run. Dalton produces revolver. "Please sit. The audience insists."

**Tone:** Revelation of true threat, mask dropping, violence emerging, trapped

## CHAPTER 21: TRAPPED
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Dalton herds them at gunpoint into snack bar storage room, locks heavy door. "I need time to prepare. Screening must be perfect. You're honored guests, not prisoners." Locks door from outside. Windowless concrete room, no escape. Kevin searches: solid door, exterior hinges. Greg hyperventilates. Lisa cries silently. Nathan and Samantha process: his "masterpiece" means recreating fire with them as victims. Burn them, film it as deranged artistic statement. Kevin finds ventilation grate too small for adults. They hear Dalton outside moving equipment, talking to ghosts: "Yes, tomorrow night. Fuel gathered. Cameras will capture everything. They'll finally understand." Hours pass. Try breaking door—impossible. Greg finds loose wall section, start chipping with tools, desperate.

**Tone:** Claustrophobic desperation, death sentence delivered, time running out, ingenuity versus futility

## CHAPTER 22: ESCAPE ATTEMPT
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

After hours, breach wall into adjacent kitchen. Also boarded but boards old, weakened. Kevin and Nathan force them quietly, crack opening to outside. Past midnight, dark. Dalton in booth working. Crawl out one by one. Freedom twenty feet across lot to fence gap. Dalton emerges carrying gasoline canisters, arranging them around lot. They freeze behind snack bar. He's setting up fire, humming theater organ music. Nathan whispers: stop him, not just escape. If they run, he finds new victims or dies in fire. Samantha suggests destroying projector—anchor to delusion. Kevin agrees: sabotage equipment, break fantasy, shock him to reality or prevent fire. Split up: Lisa and Greg run for highway for help. Nathan, Samantha, Kevin go to booth to end this.

**Tone:** Escape tension, moral decision to confront rather than flee, splitting party, action escalating

## CHAPTER 23: CONFRONTATION IN THE BOOTH
**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Nathan, Samantha, Kevin sneak to booth while Dalton outside. Enter through back. Projector running test reel. Kevin dismantles it—pulling components, smashing lenses. Samantha grabs film canisters as evidence. Nathan films everything. Dalton appears in doorway, sees destruction, screams—animal anguish. "No! You're destroying it! The audience needs it!" Rushes Kevin, who fights him. Dalton skeletal but desperate-strong, swinging revolver. Nathan tackles him. Gun fires wild, hits film canister, spills celluloid. Samantha pulls them apart. Struggle knocks flood lamp into spilled film. Nitrate film ignites instantly—explosive chemical fire. Flames spread across booth floor. Kevin yells evacuate. Dalton breaks free, frantically saving canisters, burning hands. "The collection! The audience!" Nathan drags him doorward. Dalton fights, choosing films over life. Fire reaches gasoline stored in booth. Structure erupts.

**Tone:** Violent confrontation, chaos and fire, split-second decisions, disaster spiraling

## CHAPTER 24: THE FIRE
**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Kevin, Nathan, Samantha escape booth as it becomes inferno. Dalton still inside, silhouetted against flames, cradling canisters, talking to invisible audience. "It's alright. We'll watch it burn together. Just like '72. Together forever." Roof collapses. Can't reach him. Fire spreads to snack bar, dry desert scrub. Kevin pulls them from heat. Run to lot center, away from flames. Nathan screaming Dalton's name—wanted to stop him, not kill. Samantha in shock. Screen catches fire, enormous torch visible for miles. Realize Lisa and Greg are in darkness—call for them. No response. Did they escape? Speaker posts heat up, creating eerie whistling. Kevin hears engine behind them: van rolling toward them, no driver, pushed from behind snack bar. Stops. Keys in ignition. Dalton's final gift—or ghost intervention?

**Tone:** Catastrophic climax, tragic villain death, chaos and salvation, questions multiply

## CHAPTER 25: EVACUATION
**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Kevin tries van—starts. Dalton must've restored distributor cap and refueled before planned fire. Drive through fence gap, circle to find Lisa and Greg. Spot them half-mile down access road, running. Pick them up. Greg sobbing with relief, Lisa catatonic. Speed toward highway as Stardust burns behind them, lighting desert orange. Flag down trucker at highway junction, radios emergency services. Fire trucks, police, ambulances arrive. Students treated for smoke inhalation and shock. Tell story: squatter in ruins, confrontation, accidental fire. Police search controlled inferno. Find remains in booth—one body, badly burned. Dental records later confirm: Dalton Reed, missing since 1972, dead at 54. Case closed. Students know truth is more complicated, tragic. Man who loved cinema so much it destroyed him.

**Tone:** Desperate escape, rescue, official version versus lived reality, survivors processing trauma

## CHAPTER 26: AFTERMATH
**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Three days later. Tucson motel, giving police statements. Official story: Dalton Reed, disturbed projectionist who started 1972 fire, lived in ruins ever since. Confronted students, fire during struggle, refused evacuation. Nine 1972 deaths attributed posthumously. Case resolved. Media coverage intense—"Ghost of Stardust finally laid to rest." Students minor celebrities, local news interviews. Nathan refuses interviews, wracked with guilt. Kevin clinical in statements, sticks to facts. Samantha can't stop talking, processing through analysis. Lisa hasn't spoken since fire. Greg drinking heavily. Retrieve salvaged equipment from police—much destroyed, but Nathan's camera survived, Greg's audio recorder intact. Debate watching footage. Samantha argues necessity—evidence, documentation, meaning. Nathan doesn't want to see. Eventually watch together in motel room.

**Tone:** Post-traumatic processing, media circus, official closure versus personal wound, truth hidden in footage

## CHAPTER 27: THE FOOTAGE
**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Footage is surreal. Nathan's camera captured booth confrontation, fight, fire starting. But captured more: as Dalton burns refusing to leave, camera sees shapes around him. Silhouettes like people, arranged as if seated. Transparent, flickering, could be smoke and flame—or nine victims watching. Greg's audio during fire is worse: underneath roar and shouting, multiple voices. Laughter. Applause. Woman's voice: "Beautiful show, Dalton." Child: "Do it again!" Voices overlap, phantom audience cheering fire. Kevin argues audio artifacts, heat affecting equipment. But nine distinct voices matching victim count. Lisa speaks for first time in days: "They were there. I saw them in booth window. They forgave him." Samantha doesn't know what to believe. Nathan decides: won't include this footage in documentary. Some things shouldn't be shared.

**Tone:** Horror confirmed or denied, evidence that proves nothing, group grappling with unexplainable

## CHAPTER 28: COMPLETING THE DOCUMENTARY
**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Two months later, November 1983. Nathan edited documentary using footage—"The Last Screening." Focuses on drive-in culture's death, interviews with former Stardust employees and customers, historical context on 1972 fire, their discovery of Dalton's survival. Omits supernatural elements, ghost voices, inexplicable footage. Tragic human story: man destroyed by obsession and isolation. Film powerful, elegiac, respectful to victims and Dalton. Submits to festivals. Accepted to three, wins award at small New Mexico festival. But Nathan feels hollow. Awards mean nothing. Exploited tragedy for thesis. People died—including Dalton, mentally ill and needing help, not confrontation. Samantha argues they documented truth, preserved memory. Lisa says victims wanted story told—ghosts guided them there. Kevin says belief doesn't matter; preventing next Dalton matters.

**Tone:** Creative resolution, awards meaningless, ethical reckoning, diverse responses to trauma

## CHAPTER 29: MOVING FORWARD
**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Spring 1984. Group scattered. Nathan graduated, moved to Los Angeles, production assistant work, hasn't touched camera since. Samantha in graduate school for film history, thesis on cinema and mental illness. Kevin returned to TV station, refuses to discuss Stardust. Greg dropped out, construction work full-time, won't watch movies. Lisa transferred schools, studying painting instead of film. Minimal contact—experience bonded and broke them simultaneously. Nathan receives letter from Samantha: Stardust site sold to developers, will be demolished for strip mall. Thinks they should witness the end. Nathan refuses. She goes alone with camera. Films bulldozers tearing down screen, booth remains hauled away, speaker posts uprooted. Desert reclaiming lot. Final closure. Leaving at dusk, her camera malfunctions. Batteries die. Hears it: faint organ music like old theater, from nowhere.

**Tone:** Time passed, survivors diverged, final destruction of location, lingering presence

## CHAPTER 30: THE ETERNAL SCREENING
**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Present day. Stardust site now shopping center: chain stores, parking lot, historical marker only. But locals share stories. Some nights, people see glow in empty lot behind stores. Like projection beam hitting nothing. No source, just light illuminating air. Some hear music, voices, laughter. Teenagers dare each other to visit after dark. Most see nothing. A few report same vision: rows of translucent cars filled with people, watching film that isn't there. Gaunt figure in projection beam operating equipment that doesn't exist, playing eternal show for audience that may or may not be ghosts. Footage eventually leaked online, including supernatural elements Nathan cut. Urban legend now, debated on paranormal forums. Some believe, some don't. Truth remains ambiguous. Cinema was Dalton Reed's religion. Perhaps in death he found eternal congregation. Show goes on.

**Tone:** Denouement, time dissolves, legend born, ambiguity preserved, eternal haunting, bittersweet close
