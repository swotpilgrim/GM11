# Chapter 30: The Eternal Screening

Present day.

The Stardust Plaza shopping center sits on East Valencia Road, twenty miles outside Tucson. Target anchors the north end, Walgreens the south. Between them: Starbucks, Chipotle, AT&T store, nail salon, dentist office. Standard American strip mall, indistinguishable from thousands of others.

A small bronze plaque near the Target entrance marks the site's history: *Site of the Stardust Drive-In Theater, 1958-1972. Nine lives lost October 14, 1972. May they rest in peace.*

Nothing mentions Dalton Reed. Nothing mentions the 1983 fire. The official history ends in 1972.

But locals know better.

Ask anyone in Tucson over fifty about the Stardust and they'll tell stories. The 1972 tragedy. The lone projectionist who lived in the ruins for eleven years. The film students who barely escaped his final screening. Some details accurate, most embellished, all colored by time and retelling.

The documentary *The Last Screening* won Best Documentary Short at the 1984 Santa Fe Independent Film Festival. It screened at a dozen other festivals, generated significant media coverage, launched Nathan Pierce's career as a documentary filmmaker. He's made seventeen documentaries since, won an Emmy, been nominated for an Oscar.

But none of his other films generated the debate that *The Last Screening* still inspires forty years later.

The footage leaked online in 1998—someone digitized Nathan's film without permission, posted it to early video sharing sites. It spread quickly. By 2005, *The Last Screening* had been viewed millions of times, dissected frame by frame on paranormal forums, analyzed by film scholars and ghost hunters alike.

The nine silhouettes in the smoke remain the most debated element. Believers point to them as proof of the afterlife. Skeptics dismiss them as pareidolia and camera damage. Neither side convinces the other. The argument continues.

Greg Patterson runs a successful construction company in Tucson. He's never publicly discussed the Stardust beyond the original police statement. Journalists who've tracked him down are met with polite refusals. "It was a long time ago. I'd rather not revisit it."

But those who know him say he won't watch films. His home has no television. He's never been to a movie theater since October 1983.

Lisa Huang became a successful painter, her work exploring themes of memory and trauma. She's had gallery shows in San Francisco and New York. Critics note the recurring motif in her paintings: transparent figures arranged in rows, watching something beyond the canvas's edge.

In a 2015 interview, she said: "The Stardust taught me that the dead don't leave. They stay with us—as memories, as influences, as presences we feel but can't prove. My paintings try to capture that liminal space between presence and absence."

Kevin Morrison served twenty years in the Air Force, retired as a Master Sergeant, now works as a consultant for military logistics firms. He's spoken twice about the Stardust—once to a Defense Department psychologist researching trauma response, once to a rational skeptic podcast debunking paranormal claims.

Both times he insisted there were no ghosts. Just a disturbed man, a tragic situation, and human brains creating patterns from chaos.

"I saw what I saw," he told the podcast host. "And what I saw can be explained rationally. People want mystery. I want truth."

Samantha Kelly earned her PhD in Film Studies from UCLA. Her dissertation, *Cinema and Delusion: Parasocial Relationships with the Dead*, became a influential text in film psychology. She's now a professor at USC, teaching courses on documentary ethics and the relationship between observation and participation.

She writes occasionally about the Stardust in academic journals, always careful to separate experience from interpretation. Her position: whether the nine victims' spirits were literally present doesn't matter as much as the fact that Dalton Reed believed they were. Belief shaped reality for him. That's the documentary's real subject.

Nathan Pierce has never made another documentary about the supernatural. His work focuses on human stories grounded in verifiable fact—labor struggles, environmental disasters, political campaigns. Serious, important, award-winning films that avoid ambiguity.

But he still gets asked about the Stardust at every screening, every Q&A, every interview.

"Do you believe in ghosts?" they ask.

His answer has remained consistent for forty years: "I believe in what I filmed. What that footage shows is open to interpretation. I'm a documentarian. I present evidence. You decide what it means."

The Stardust site itself has developed a reputation.

Employees at the Target report strange occurrences—electronics malfunctioning in specific aisles, cold spots near the back of the store, the smell of smoke when nothing's burning. Management dismisses it as old wiring and imagination.

But the turnover rate in that Target is three times the company average.

Teenagers dare each other to visit the site at night. Most see nothing. But some report phenomena: faint projection light in empty air behind the shopping center, the sound of film running through a projector, voices speaking in the darkness.

On October 14th each year—the anniversary of the original 1972 fire—local paranormal investigators gather in the lot behind the stores. They run equipment, record EVP, document cold spots and electromagnetic anomalies. Results are inconclusive but intriguing. Nine distinct temperature drops in a pattern suggesting cars arranged for optimal screen viewing. Audio that might be voices or might be wind through structures.

The investigators publish their findings online. Skeptics debunk them. The debate continues.

But the most compelling reports come from those who aren't looking for anything supernatural.

A Target employee closing the store alone late one October night saw them: rows of translucent cars in the empty lot behind the building, arranged facing nothing. People sitting in those cars, indistinct but definitely present, watching empty air like a movie played on a screen that wasn't there.

She quit the next day.

A construction worker renovating the Chipotle's roof saw a gaunt man in a projectionist's vest standing in the alley at dawn, staring at the sky like he was looking for something. When the worker called down to ask if he needed help, the figure turned toward him—and the worker saw through him to the wall beyond. Then the figure faded like morning mist.

The worker finished the job but refuses to work on Valencia Road anymore.

Are these sightings real? Hallucination? Collective delusion spawned by knowing the Stardust's history?

No one can say definitively.

The footage from October 1983 exists. It's been analyzed by film experts, paranormal researchers, skeptics, and believers. It shows what it shows—and what it shows remains subject to interpretation.

Nathan's camera captured phenomena. Whether that phenomena was supernatural or psychological, real or imagined, is a question each viewer must answer individually.

What's certain: ten people died at the Stardust Drive-In across its history. Nine in 1972. One in 1983. All connected to cinema—watching it, showing it, preserving it, worshipping it.

And some nights—particularly in October, particularly when the desert air is still and the sky is clear—people report seeing light in the empty space behind Stardust Plaza. A rectangle of projected light hitting nothing, showing nothing, illuminating only dust and darkness.

But if you watch long enough, some say, you can see what's being shown.

A horror film from the '70s. Classic drive-in fare. The image flickers, the sound crackles from speakers that don't exist, and in the glow of that impossible projection, nine rows of translucent cars arrange themselves.

People sit in those cars. Families. Couples. Individuals. All watching the screen that isn't there, experiencing cinema the way it was meant to be experienced—collectively, under the stars, part of a community.

And in the projection beam's source, where the booth should be but isn't, a figure operates equipment. Tall, gaunt, movements practiced from decades of repetition. Changing reels with care, adjusting focus with dedication, tending his congregation with love.

Dalton Reed, still running shows for the faithful.

Or nothing at all. Just headlights and imagination, pareidolia and suggestion, the human tendency to see patterns in randomness.

The Stardust Drive-In is gone. Demolished, bulldozed, paved over with commerce. The Stardust Plaza stands in its place, serving a community that barely remembers what came before.

But some things resist erasure. Some stories persist beyond their physical locations. Some screenings continue long after the projector goes dark.

Cinema was Dalton Reed's religion. The drive-in was his temple. The nine victims—willing or not—became his congregation.

And religion doesn't end just because the church burns down.

On certain nights, if you stand in the right spot behind the Target and listen carefully, you can hear it: the mechanical click of film through sprockets, the hum of a carbon arc lamp, the rustle of an audience settling in for the show.

You can smell popcorn and gasoline and desert dust.

You can feel eyes watching you from darkness.

The faithful nine, waiting for the lights to dim.

The eternal screening, never-ending.

Real or imagined doesn't matter anymore.

The Stardust exists now in the space between. Between fact and legend. Between documented history and folklore. Between what happened and what people believe happened.

And in that space—liminal, ambiguous, eternal—the show goes on.

Dalton Reed promised his congregation that cinema was worth dying for.

Whether they agreed or not, they're still watching.

The screen may be gone, but the story plays forever.

Fade to black.

But never truly to silence.

In the desert night, nine speaker posts that don't exist anymore whistle in the wind.

And somewhere in the dark, someone's still listening.

The show must go on.

Always.

Forever.

*End.*
