# Chapter 23: Confrontation in the Booth

The revolver was heavier than Nathan expected. He'd never held a gun before, never wanted to. But now it was in his hand, pointed at a man, and the weight of it felt like a terrible responsibility.

"Kevin, get off him," Nathan said.

Kevin rolled away, breathing hard. Dalton remained on the ground, staring up at the burning booth with something like ecstasy on his face.

The fire was spreading fast. What had started as controlled lines of flame had become wild, feeding on decades of dried wood and desert-baked materials. The projection booth was fully engulfed, flames roaring from windows, smoke pouring into the dawn sky. But inside, impossibly, the projector kept running—Nathan could see the beam through the smoke, still hitting the screen.

"We need to leave," Kevin said. "This whole place is going up."

"Not yet." Nathan kept the gun on Dalton. "We're stopping this. We're saving what we can."

"There's nothing to save. It's over."

"The projector." Nathan pointed to the booth. "He's kept it running for eleven years. It's not just equipment—it's evidence. Proof of what he did, how he lived. We need it."

"It's on fire!"

"Not completely. The booth's burning but the projection room's concrete. If we move fast—"

Dalton laughed from the ground. "You want to save it? The machine that's kept me company for eleven years? Go ahead. Try."

Kevin stared at Nathan. "You're insane. That building's an inferno."

"I'm a documentarian. This is the story." Nathan grabbed Kevin's shirt. "Help me or don't, but I'm getting that projector."

Something in Nathan's voice— desperation, determination, maybe just madness—made Kevin nod. "Five minutes. Then we run whether you have it or not."

Nathan handed him the revolver. "Watch Dalton. If he moves, shoot him in the leg."

"Gladly."

Nathan ran toward the burning booth. Heat hit him from thirty feet away, a physical wall of it. Smoke poured from the entrance, black and chemical-smelling. The building groaned, structure weakening.

He pulled his shirt over his nose and mouth, ducked low where the air was slightly clearer, and plunged inside.

The heat was overwhelming. Paint bubbled on walls, plastic equipment melted into grotesque shapes, the air itself felt combustible. Sweat evaporated instantly from Nathan's skin. His eyes watered from smoke, lungs screaming for clean air. But the rear of the booth—the projection room—was concrete and steel, fire-resistant by design from when drive-ins were built to last. The projector stood on its mount, still running, film threading through sprockets with mechanical persistence as flames consumed the building around it.

Dalton had maintained this machine for eleven years, treating it like sacred artifact. Carbon arc lamp housing, film gates, reels—all period equipment worth thousands to collectors. But more importantly, it was the anchor to his delusion. Destroy this, and maybe you destroyed his reason to keep burning.

Nathan found the power cable, yanked it from the wall. The projector died, the beam cutting off, plunging the booth into smoke-dimmed darkness lit only by flames.

Then he started dismantling. The carbon rods first—he pulled them from the housing, burning his fingers but getting them free. Then the lenses, five precision-ground glass lenses that were the projector's heart. They were hot enough to blister skin, but Nathan grabbed them anyway, shoving them into his jacket pockets.

The film gate assembly next—he unscrewed it with shaking hands, smoke filling his lungs, vision blurring. The mechanism came free, heavy and complex.

Behind him, the booth's front wall collapsed. Flames roared inward. No more time.

Nathan grabbed what he had—carbon rods, lenses still hot enough to burn through jacket fabric, the film gate assembly—and ran. Smoke blinded him completely, heat scorched exposed skin on his neck and hands, the building screamed as support beams gave way. The floor tilted beneath him. Ceiling tiles rained down. He found the door more by instinct than sight, muscle memory from entering, and burst out into cool morning air that felt like ice against his superheated skin.

Kevin pulled him away from the building. "Did you get it?"

Nathan coughed, lungs burning, and nodded. He held up the components—charred, damaged, but intact. The heart of the projector, if not the whole machine.

Dalton had stood up, Kevin's gun trained on him but unheeded. He stared at Nathan with an expression Nathan couldn't read. Not anger. Not fear. Something closer to grief.

"You took the lamp," Dalton said quietly. "The heart."

"It's over, Dalton. No more screenings. No more delusion."

"You don't understand." Dalton looked at the burning booth, at the components in Nathan's hands. "That projector was my connection. My link to them. Without it, how can they watch?"

"They're not watching. They never were. It was just you, alone, creating meaning from machinery."

Dalton's face crumpled. For a moment, the madness lifted and Nathan saw the man underneath—broken, exhausted, aware of what he'd done.

"Eleven years," Dalton whispered. "Eleven years I've kept this place alive. Maintained the ritual. And for what? So you could destroy it in five minutes?"

"You destroyed it yourself when you lit the match."

The screen caught fire. The massive structure, seven stories of wood and canvas and steel, ignited along its base and raced upward. Flames climbed it like living things, consuming the surface where thousands of images had played. The Stardust's iconic screen, visible from the highway, burning in the desert dawn.

Dalton watched it burn and started to cry.

"They're leaving," he said. "I can feel them leaving. The faithful nine. Without the booth, without the projector, they have no reason to stay. I've lost them."

Kevin grabbed Nathan's arm. "We need to go. Fuel canisters, fire—this whole lot could explode."

But Dalton was moving. Fast, sudden, catching them both off guard. He ran toward the burning booth.

"No!" Nathan yelled.

But Dalton didn't stop. He ran straight into the inferno, into flames that engulfed him instantly. For one terrible moment he was silhouetted against the fire, arms spread like he was embracing it.

Then the booth's roof collapsed. Concrete and burning wood and eleven years of obsessive maintenance came crashing down. Dalton Reed vanished beneath it, swallowed by the fire he'd started.

"Jesus Christ," Kevin breathed.

Nathan raised his camera—had been filming the whole time without consciously choosing to—and captured it. Dalton's final moment. The booth's collapse. The end of the Stardust Drive-In.

The screen was fully engulfed now, flames reaching toward the pale morning sky. Speaker posts heated up around the lot, metal glowing, beginning to warp. Fire spread to the snack bar, to every structure Dalton had maintained.

"We go now," Kevin said, pulling Nathan backward. "This whole place is coming down."

They ran toward the fence gap, carrying what they'd salvaged—projector components, Nathan's camera, evidence and testimony. Behind them, the Stardust became a pillar of fire visible for miles.

At the fence, Nathan looked back. The lot was an inferno. Everything burning. The screen collapsed as he watched, falling forward in a cascade of flame and sparks. The projection booth was unrecognizable, just burning rubble with Dalton's body somewhere underneath.

And for just a moment—Nathan would never be sure if it was real or trick of smoke and heat and exhaustion—he saw them. Nine silhouettes arranged in rows across the burning lot, transparent as air, backlit by flames. They sat exactly where Dalton had said they always sat. The Morrison family in their third-row center spot, children between parents. The Delgados to the left. Rollins alone in the back corner. All of them watching the screen as it collapsed, watching the final show like they had every Friday night for forty-one years. Watching until the very end.

Then the smoke shifted and they were gone. If they'd ever been there at all.

Kevin saw Nathan's expression. "What?"

"Nothing. Heat playing tricks."

They moved away from the fence, into the desert scrub beyond the Stardust's perimeter. The fire was fully involved now, black smoke visible from the highway. Someone would call it in soon. Fire trucks, police, investigators—all coming to find ruins and questions.

"We wait here," Kevin said. "For Samantha and Lisa and Greg. Assuming they made it."

"They made it." Nathan didn't know if he believed that, but he needed to.

They sat in the desert watching the Stardust burn. The sun rose higher, turning the sky from gray to blue. Somewhere in the distance, sirens began to wail—someone had seen the smoke.

Nathan checked his camera. The footage was intact. Everything from the screening to the confrontation to Dalton's final run into the flames. Documentary evidence of obsession, delusion, and death.

"Was it worth it?" Kevin asked. "The projector parts?"

Nathan looked at the components he'd salvaged. Scorched, damaged, maybe unusable. But real. Tangible proof of what Dalton had maintained, what he'd valued above life itself.

"Ask me when we're out of here."

The sirens grew louder. And from the east, three figures appeared—Samantha, Lisa, and Greg, running toward them with a Pima County Sheriff's vehicle close behind.

They'd made it. All of them.

The Stardust burned, and they survived to tell its story.

Whether that story included nine ghosts watching cinema for eternity, Nathan would leave for others to decide.

The footage would show what it showed.

And the rest would remain mystery, ambiguous as smoke.
