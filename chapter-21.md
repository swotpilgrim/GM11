# Chapter 21: Trapped

Kevin's hands moved across the concrete wall, searching for weakness. Windowless, solid, secure. A concrete box designed to keep things in.

The camera's LED light cast harsh shadows, turning the small space into a horror film. Which, Nathan supposed, was exactly what they were living.

"Door's steel," Kevin reported. "Deadbolt outside, hinges outside. We're not getting through it."

"Walls?"

"Concrete. Six inches thick." Kevin tapped the surface. "We'd need days and real tools."

Greg sat in the corner, knees to chest, breathing too fast. "We're going to die here. He's going to burn us alive and there's nothing we can do."

"Stop." Lisa's voice was quiet but firm. "That doesn't help."

"None of this helps!" Greg's control fractured. "I told you we shouldn't have come. I told you the Stardust was cursed. My grandfather warned me, said Dalton was a madman, said this place was evil. But no, Nathan needed his fucking documentary—"

"Greg." Nathan's voice was harder than he intended. "You're right. This is my fault. I brought us here. I ignored the warnings because I wanted the story. But right now, blame doesn't matter. Survival does."

Greg laughed bitterly. "Survival. We're locked in concrete twenty miles from help with a homicidal maniac. What survival?"

Kevin crouched in front of him. "You worked construction. Help me find a weak point."

"There isn't one. This was built to code in the '60s. Solid."

"Then we make one." Kevin examined the ceiling. "Every structure has vulnerabilities."

Samantha had been quiet, thinking. Now she spoke: "He said he'd bring food and water. When he opens the door, that's our chance. Jump him, five against one."

"Five against one with a gun," Nathan reminded her. "Who's willing to take a bullet?"

Silence.

"We could rush him," Kevin said. "If we all go at once, he can only shoot one of us. Maybe two. The rest get the gun."

"And two of us die," Greg said.

"Better than five of us burning."

Lisa made a small sound. The casual math of sacrifice was breaking something in her.

Nathan moved beside her. "We're getting out. All of us. Nobody's dying."

"You can't promise that. This place... Nathan, I keep feeling them. The nine people. I know how that sounds, but I swear I feel them watching."

"Lisa—"

"What if he's right? What if they are here?"

"They don't." Kevin's voice was flat. "There's no such thing as ghosts. Dalton's insane, not supernatural."

"Then explain the audio," Greg said. "My recorder picked up nine distinct voices. Nine voices, nine victims."

"Radio interference. CB bleed. Atmospheric conditions."

"You're reaching."

"And you're feeding delusion." Kevin's temper flared. "We're dealing with a psychotic arsonist, not a haunting. Focus on what's real."

"What's real is that we're trapped," Samantha said. "And arguing about ghosts doesn't change that."

She'd been examining boxes in the corner. Old concession supplies—cups, napkins, straws. Nothing useful. Then she found something wrapped in canvas at the bottom.

A wrench. Two feet long, solid iron.

Kevin took it, tested its weight. "When he opens the door, I go first. Swing for his gun hand, disarm him before he can fire."

"If you miss, he shoots you," Nathan said.

"If I don't try, he burns all of us."

Footsteps outside. Everyone froze. The deadbolt scraped.

Dalton's voice came through: "I'm setting water and sandwiches by the door. Peanut butter. Please don't try anything foolish. I'd hate for someone to get hurt before tomorrow's screening."

The door opened wider. Dalton stood in the opening, backlit. The revolver was in his hand.

"Back against the far wall, please."

They had no choice. Kevin clutched the wrench behind his back, but Dalton saw it.

"You can keep that. You might need it—though I don't think you'll succeed in time." Dalton set down a jug of water and a paper bag. "The faithful nine say you'll be comfortable enough for one night."

"They're not real," Greg said.

Dalton's expression went sad. "You'll meet them tomorrow. They're very excited to have new people join the congregation. Mrs. Morrison especially—she's always been the welcoming sort."

"Dalton." Samantha stepped forward. "You don't have to do this. If you let us go, we won't tell anyone. We'll just leave, forget this happened."

He laughed gently. "Forget? No, no. You can't forget the Stardust any more than I can. This place marks you. Changes you. You came here for a reason—the same reason the faithful nine came that night in '72. You were meant to witness the ending."

"We're not meant to die for your delusion," Kevin said.

"It's not delusion. It's faith." Dalton's eyes were calm. "You'll understand tomorrow. The films I've chosen will make everything clear. Cinema as transformative art. Death as the ultimate cut. Fire as projector light."

He started to close the door, paused.

"Oh, and don't try to escape during the night. I'll be sleeping in the booth with a clear line of sight to this door. I'm a light sleeper. Any noise and I'll investigate."

The door swung shut. The bolt slid home.

They were alone again.

Kevin immediately went to work on the walls with the wrench, chipping at mortar between concrete blocks. The work was loud, echoing in the small space, but there was no help for it.

"He said he'll hear us," Lisa warned.

"Let him." Kevin struck harder. "Maybe he shoots me. Still better than waiting for tomorrow."

The mortar was old, crumbling under the wrench's impact. But even at this pace, they'd need hours. Every strike echoed across the desert.

After thirty minutes, Kevin had chipped away maybe a quarter-inch. At this rate, they'd need ten hours to create a hole big enough to crawl through. Dawn would come in six.

"We're not going to make it through in time," Samantha said.

Kevin kept striking. "So we work faster."

Nathan joined him with his camera's metal edge. The equipment gouged and bent, but he didn't care. Greg used his belt buckle. Even Lisa helped with a plastic cup, scooping debris.

They worked in desperate silence, scraping and chipping against old concrete.

An hour passed. Two. They'd opened a gap maybe two inches deep, two feet wide. Progress, but nowhere near enough.

Nathan felt eyes on them. Probably Dalton watching from the booth. Or paranoia.

Lisa had gone still, staring at the corner.

"Do you hear that?" she whispered.

They stopped working. Listened.

Faint voices. Multiple voices, indistinct, coming from nowhere and everywhere. Not through the door or walls—from the air itself, like the storage room was remembering sound.

"Audio bleed," Kevin said. "Dalton's playing recordings through the speaker system."

But Greg had his recorder out, headphones on. His face went white.

"That's not coming through the speakers. It's... it's in the room. Multiple sources. Kids' voices. A woman humming. Someone laughing."

"Shut up," Kevin said. "You're psyching yourself out."

"Listen!" Greg yanked off the headphones, held them out. The audio was faint but unmistakable—ambient sounds of people who weren't there.

Samantha took the headphones, listened, her analytical mask slipping. "That's... I don't know what that is."

Nathan listened next. And he heard them. Children talking, high and quick. A woman's voice, soft, in Spanish—Rosa Delgado? A man clearing his throat. The ambient sounds of a gathered crowd, faint as memory.

"The faithful nine," Lisa whispered. "They're here. Dalton was telling the truth."

"No." Kevin's voice was hard. "There's a rational explanation. Acoustic phenomenon, leftover audio from the speakers, something. Not ghosts."

But even he looked shaken.

The voices faded, leaving only silence and the desert wind.

They returned to chipping at the wall, but the work felt different now. Futile. Like they were trapped not just by concrete and a madman, but by the Stardust itself—by eleven years of death and delusion soaked into every surface.

At 3 AM, Greg found the loose section.

Lower corner, where wall met floor. The mortar there was powder, crumbling at a touch. Beneath it, the concrete blocks shifted slightly. A flaw in the original construction, or just decades of desert temperature changes creating stress fractures.

They worked the section carefully, quietly. The blocks came free one by one—first one, then another, then three in a row. The gap widened.

"Kitchen's on the other side," Greg whispered. "Also boarded up, but boards we can break."

By 4:30 AM they'd opened an eighteen-inch hole near the floor. Tight, but passable. One at a time, they could crawl through into the kitchen, then force the boards covering the window, escape into the desert.

"We go now," Kevin said. "Before dawn, before he wakes."

"Then what?" Samantha asked. "Run twenty miles?"

"Ten to the truck stop on Highway 10. We make it by noon, flag down help, come back with police before tonight's 'screening.'"

"He'll track us down," Greg said. "He knows this terrain."

"Maybe. Or maybe we're faster than a sixty-pound madman who's been eating canned food for eleven years." Kevin was already at the hole. "Either way, we try. Because the alternative is burning alive."

Nathan made a decision. "Samantha, Lisa, Greg—you three go. Get to the highway, get help. Kevin and I stay."

"What?" Greg stared at him. "Why?"

"To stop him if you don't make it back in time. To sabotage the equipment, destroy his fuel, break his plan." Nathan met Kevin's eyes. "Someone has to make sure he doesn't just do this anyway with us gone. Burn the Stardust with himself inside. End it all alone."

Kevin nodded slowly. "The projector. We destroy it, we destroy his anchor to the delusion. Maybe shock him back to reality."

"Or make him more dangerous," Samantha said.

"We're out of good options." Nathan helped Lisa toward the hole. "Go. Move fast. Send help. And if we don't make it..." He raised his camera. "This footage survives. Tell the story."

They went through one by one. Lisa first, then Greg, then Samantha. She paused halfway through the hole, looked back.

"Don't die for a documentary, Nathan."

Then she was gone.

Kevin and Nathan sat in the storage room, listening to faint sounds from the kitchen—boards breaking, the creak of a window frame. Then silence. The three had escaped.

"Now what?" Nathan asked.

Kevin picked up the wrench. "Now we wait for Dalton to check on us in the morning. When he opens the door, we take him."

They sat in the dim light of Nathan's camera, waiting for dawn, waiting for confrontation, waiting to see if their friends would make it to the highway before the desert killed them.

Outside, the stars wheeled toward morning.

And in the projection booth, Dalton Reed dreamed of fire.
