# Chapter 12: The Shrine

Lisa froze, camera still in her hands. The breathing wasn't coming from beside her in the crawlspace.

It was coming from below.

Someone was in the projection booth. Had been there the whole time she'd been reading, filming, exploring the shrine. She'd been so focused on the photographs and journals that she hadn't heard the door open, hadn't noticed footsteps on the stairs.

She stayed perfectly still, barely breathing, praying whoever it was hadn't heard her.

Through gaps in the floorboards she could see movement. A shadow passing through morning light. Slow, deliberate. Not searching—just moving through familiar space with the confidence of ownership.

The shadow stopped directly below the crawlspace opening.

Lisa's heart hammered. Should she call out? Pretend she had permission to be here? Or stay silent and hope he didn't look up?

The breathing continued. Steady. Patient. Like he was waiting for something.

Then it stopped.

Silence. Complete and terrible.

Lisa realized he knew she was up here. Had known the whole time. The shrine, the journals—he'd left them accessible. Wanted someone to find them. To read them. To understand.

She looked at the leather journal in her hands. Eleven years of entries. She'd only read the recent ones—the delusions fully formed, conversations with ghosts, plans for "five new members." But what about the beginning? The first days after the fire when Dalton Reed fled into the desert and somehow survived?

Lisa opened the journal to the first page. The handwriting here was different—neat, precise, educated script. The writing of someone in control.

October 21, 1972. The day after the fire.

"They understand now. The purification was necessary. Cinema required sacrifice. Mr. Rollins sees that now. I hear him at night, speaking from the flames. 'You were right, Dalton. I was wrong. Art matters more than profit.' He forgives me. They all forgive me. The Morrison children play in the lot, their laughter echoing under the stars. The Delgados hold hands, finally free to appreciate what they died for. Timothy runs the snack bar with pride, no longer humiliated by Rollins's demands. They're free now. Pure audience. Perfect appreciation."

Lisa felt sick. This was written one day after nine people burned to death. Already the delusion was complete. Already Dalton had convinced himself the victims forgave him, that their deaths had meaning.

She flipped ahead, hands shaking. November 1972:

"The desert tried to take me. Three nights of exposure, temperatures dropping to freezing, no water. I should have died. But they called me back. I heard them from miles away—'Come home, Dalton. We need you. Who will run the shows?' The theater needs me. The audience needs me. So I returned. Police are gone now. They searched for weeks but found nothing. They think I died out there. They never understood that I can't die. Not while the show must go on. I am the projectionist. My duty is eternal."

January 1973:

"First screening since my return. Showed Chinatown for the Morrison family. Little Sarah cried when Faye Dunaway died—such a tender heart. But Michael explained it's only acting, helped her understand the craft. They're learning so much. Death has purified their appreciation. They see the art now, not just the story. Mr. Rollins apologized again tonight. Said he was wrong to cut corners, to value profit over quality. The fire taught him truth. He's grateful now. They all are."

The entries continued through years. Lisa watched the handwriting deteriorate—sprawling manic paragraphs alternating with obsessively neat logs, then degrading to barely legible scrawls before stabilizing again. A mind fracturing under isolation, rebuilding around delusion, fracturing again.

1974: Detailed screening schedules. Which films each ghost preferred. The Morrison children loved monster movies. The Delgados preferred romances. Timothy liked action films. Mr. Rollins was converting to art cinema, apologizing for his previous commercial taste.

1976: Long philosophical entries about cinema's death. Television killing community. Drive-ins closing across America. "We are the last. When this screen goes dark, something sacred dies. But it won't go dark. I won't let it. The show must go on. Forever."

1979: Debates with the dead about whether audiences deserved cinema anymore. "Mr. Rollins argues people have lost appreciation. Too distracted by television, convenience, commerce. But I believe they can be saved. Shown the truth. Made to understand through purification."

1981: Shorter, more pragmatic entries. Supply runs to Tucson—which dumpsters had food, which construction sites had materials, how to steal batteries without being caught. Rain catchment system repairs. Film preservation techniques to stop prints from deteriorating in desert heat.

Lisa realized the delusion had stabilized. Dalton had found equilibrium—a sustainable routine where fantasy and survival coexisted. He'd learned to function within madness, maintaining both the theater and his hallucinations with equal obsessive care.

"The photographs," Dalton said softly from below.

Lisa nearly dropped the journal. He'd spoken. First words since she'd realized he was there. Voice cultured, strained, theatrical. Like an actor unused to his lines.

"Behind the shrine," he continued. "Did you see them?"

Lisa forced herself to look. Behind the nine victim photographs, tucked along the wall, was a series of Polaroids. She leaned closer.

The first showed a man in a projectionist uniform. Clean-cut, early forties, thin but healthy. Intense eyes, neat hair, clean-shaven. The back read "D.R. - 1971."

Dalton Reed before the fire. Almost handsome. Certainly human.

The next was dated 1973. The same man but transformed—gaunt, bearded, wild-haired. Eyes still intense but now edged with mania. Clothing ragged. Desert sun darkening his skin.

1975: Barely recognizable from the first photo. Skeletal, beard tangled, face weathered to leather.

1977: More scarecrow than man. Bone-thin, hair sun-bleached nearly white, bare feet calloused thick as boot soles.

1980: A living skeleton. Skin stretched over skull, eyes sunken deep, every rib visible through torn clothing.

1982: The most recent. The transformation complete. Barely human in appearance—skeletal frame, wild tangled hair and beard, ragged clothes hanging off bones. But standing straight. Camera held steady. Pride in his stance. The projection booth visible behind him.

Timer photos, Lisa realized. He'd been documenting his own deterioration. Cataloguing what eleven years of isolation and delusion had cost his body while his mind convinced him it was worth the price.

"I was handsome once," the voice from below said quietly. "Women noticed me. I had prospects. Could have worked real theaters in Los Angeles. First-run houses. Red carpet premieres. But I loved this place. The families. The community. Friday nights when everyone came together under the stars. That meant something. Rollins killed it. Commerce over art. So I killed him."

The logic was insane but delivered with such calm certainty that Lisa almost understood. In Dalton's fractured mind, the fire wasn't murder—it was justice. Punishment for destroying something sacred.

"The others," Lisa whispered. "The families. The employees. They weren't destroying anything."

"They chose to stay," Dalton said. "I set the fire, walked away, gave them time. But they stayed in their cars. Watched. And when they died..." His voice carried something like wonder. "They understood. What it means to give everything to art. They became pure. Perfect audience. And they forgave me. I hear them every night. Conversations about film, about craft, about what's been lost. They've learned so much."

Lisa looked at the shrine. Nine faces frozen in photographs. Three children who would never grow up. A young couple who would never celebrate an anniversary. All of them trapped here in one man's delusion, forced to validate his justifications for murder.

"You know they're not real," Lisa said, forcing the words out. "The voices. The conversations. You're alone here."

Silence from below. Long enough that Lisa thought she'd made a terrible mistake.

Then: "Is a voice in your head less real than a voice in your ear? They speak. I listen. We discuss the films. What does it matter where the sound originates?"

He believed it. Completely. The delusion was total, seamless, unshakeable.

"Why did you want me to find this?" Lisa asked. "The shrine. The journals. You left them where someone would discover them."

"Because you understand," Dalton said. "You're a cinematographer. You see light, composition, the way morning transforms decay into beauty. I watched you filming at sunrise—low angles emphasizing the scale, patient attention to texture. That's not documentary work. That's art. You understand what's been lost. What I've preserved."

He'd been watching her. Studying her technique. Analyzing her artistic choices while she filmed, unaware.

"You and your friends," he continued. "The tall one who sees tragic beauty. The woman who analyzes narrative patterns. The military one who demands proof. The frightened one who grounds everything in fear. You're all perfect. Different types of appreciation. A complete audience."

"Five new members," Lisa said, remembering the journal entry. "That's what you wrote."

"Yes." Such hope in his voice. Terrible, earnest hope. "The audience has been incomplete for so long. Nine faithful souls, but they hunger for company. Fresh perspective. New eyes to see the films. You'll understand tonight."

"Tonight?"

"Sundown. I'm preparing a special screening. The perfect film—something that speaks to preservation, loss, what it means to give everything to art. You'll watch with the audience. All fourteen of us together."

Lisa's blood went cold. Fourteen. Nine dead. Five new.

She heard movement below. Footsteps approaching the ladder.

Then a hand appeared at the base—skeletal fingers, filthy with grime and grease. Two fingers missing from the left hand, old scars where they'd been severed.

A voice from directly below now. Close. At the bottom of the ladder looking up.

"You found my home," Dalton Reed said. "Do you like films?"
