# Chapter 12: The Shrine

Lisa couldn't stop shaking. Kevin had his hands on her shoulders, trying to get her to focus, but all she could see was the shrine. Nine faces arranged in an arc, candles burning, offerings laid out with obsessive precision.

"Lisa, look at me," Kevin said. His command voice, the one that cut through panic. "What happened? Why were you in the booth?"

"I... the light. I was filming..." Her voice didn't sound like her own. "The shrine. He has a shrine."

Nathan had his camera out, filming her. Documentary reflex, even now. Part of her hated him for it. Part of her understood.

"What shrine?" Kevin demanded.

"In the crawlspace. The nine victims. Their photos. Fresh candles. He's been... worshipping them. Or keeping them. I don't know which." Lisa pulled away from Kevin, wrapping her arms around herself. "And the journal. I read his journal."

They were back at the snack bar now, though Lisa didn't remember walking there. The others gathered around—Samantha taking notes, Greg pale and chain-smoking, Lisa in the center trying to explain what she'd found.

"Tell us everything," Samantha said gently. "From the beginning."

Lisa forced herself to breathe, to think. The shrine first. She described it—the photographs arranged in an arc, each one a victim of the 1972 fire. The Morrisons, all five of them. The young Delgados. The Rollins couple. Timothy Walsh, seventeen.

"Fresh candles," she emphasized. "Lit within the last day or two. White votives in glass holders. And offerings underneath. Personal items. Film strips, ticket stubs, things that might have belonged to them."

"Trophies," Kevin said grimly.

"Or memorial," Samantha countered. "Depends on intent."

"The journal explains the intent." Lisa had dropped it when she fled, but the entries were burned into her memory. "He's been writing in it for eleven years. Since right after the fire."

She recited what she remembered, starting with the earliest entries. Samantha took notes, trying to capture the exact phrasing.

"October 21, 1972. 'They understand now. The purification was necessary. Cinema required sacrifice. Mr. Rollins sees that. I hear him at night, speaking from the flames. You were right, Dalton. I was wrong. Art matters more than profit.' He thinks they forgave him. From the very beginning, he believed they forgave him."

"Delusion as coping mechanism," Samantha said. "Immediate psychological break after the trauma of what he'd done."

Lisa continued, pulling memories of other entries. The progression was clear—Dalton fleeing into the desert after the fire, hiding for weeks, then hearing voices calling him back. Returning to the drive-in. Finding it abandoned, condemned. Claiming it as his own.

"'November 12, 1972,'" Lisa quoted. "'Returned to the theater. They were waiting. All nine of them, in their cars, watching the blank screen. Mr. Rollins stood by the booth, smiling. He said: The show must go on. You're the projectionist, Dalton. It's your duty.' So he started screening films again. For ghosts."

Greg laughed bitterly. "That's fucking insane."

"Yes," Lisa agreed. "But consistent. Every entry for eleven years follows the same pattern—he describes screening films, discusses them with the victims, documents their reactions. It's elaborate. Detailed. The Morrison children asking questions about special effects. Maria Delgado requesting romantic films. Mr. Rollins critiquing modern cinema."

"Creating a complete fantasy world," Samantha said. "Populated by the people he killed, reimagined as willing participants in his obsession."

Nathan was filming, capturing Lisa's account. "What about recent entries? Anything about us?"

Lisa's hands clenched. This was the part that terrified her most.

"October 12th. He saw us arrive. Noted we had equipment, cameras. Called us 'filmmakers' and 'cinema lovers.' Said the audience—the nine victims—were excited. Asked them if he should welcome us. They said yes."

"So he's including us in the delusion," Kevin said. "Seeing us as potential... what? Audience members?"

"Five new members," Lisa whispered. "That's what he wrote. 'Finally, real people who might appreciate the work. Real eyes to see the screenings. The audience has been patient so long. Now they're rewarded. Five new members.'"

The silence that followed was heavy.

"Not audience members," Greg said slowly. "Members. Like the Morrison family are members. Like the Delgados are members."

"Five new dead people," Lisa confirmed. "That's what he means. He doesn't want us to watch films. He wants us to join the permanent audience. The ones who watch forever."

Samantha was writing frantically. "This is critical. This establishes premeditation. Intent to harm. We need to document this, get it to police."

"Did you bring the journal?" Nathan asked.

Lisa shook her head. "I dropped it when I ran. It's still up there."

"We need to get it," Nathan said immediately. "Physical evidence."

"Are you insane?" Greg demanded. "Lisa barely got out of there. You want to send someone back?"

"I'll go," Nathan said. "With Kevin. Armed with tools, quick in-and-out. Document the shrine, retrieve the journal, get back before—"

"Before what?" Lisa interrupted. "Before he notices? He already knows I was there. He let me read it. Don't you see? This was intentional. He wanted me to find it."

The implications settled over the group. Dalton had left the journal accessible, the shrine visible. Either he wanted them to know his plan, or...

"Or he doesn't see it as a secret," Samantha said, following Lisa's logic. "To him, this is normal. The victims are really there. The shrine is appropriate. The journal is just documentation of his work. He's not hiding anything because in his reality, there's nothing to hide."

"Which makes him even more dangerous," Kevin said. "No shame, no fear of consequences. Complete disconnect from reality."

Lisa pulled her knees to her chest, trying to steady herself. "There was something else. Photographs. Polaroids. Self-portraits."

She described them—the progression of images showing Dalton's deterioration over eleven years. Clean-cut projectionist becoming skeletal desert hermit. The most recent image, gaunt and wild but with sharp, aware eyes.

"He's documenting himself," Samantha said. "Creating a complete record. The journal, the photos, the screening logs. This is his life's work."

"His insane life's work," Greg corrected. "Which apparently culminates in adding us to his ghost audience."

Nathan was pacing now, camera temporarily forgotten. "We need to think tactically. What does he want? Really want?"

"An audience," Lisa said. "That's all he's ever wanted. People who understand cinema the way he does. Who appreciate the art."

"Then we give him that," Nathan said. "We engage. We talk about film. We show appreciation. We become the audience he wants."

"The living audience," Kevin specified. "Not the dead one."

"If we can convince him we're more valuable alive than dead, maybe he lets us leave."

"Or maybe he's too far gone," Greg countered. "Maybe in his head, death is the only way to make us permanent. The Morrison kids didn't choose to stay. They died and he claimed them. Maybe that's the only membership he knows."

Lisa thought about the journal entries. The way Dalton wrote about the victims—never acknowledging they were dead, always describing them as present and willing. In his mind, the fire hadn't been murder. It had been transformation. Creating the perfect, eternal audience.

"He won't let us leave," she said quietly. "Not alive. Because living people leave. Living people abandon theaters and let them decay. Only dead people stay forever."

The room went silent. Because they all knew she was right.

Dalton Reed had spent eleven years with an audience that never criticized, never left, never stopped appreciating his work. Nine people bound to the Stardust Drive-In through death, forever watching his screenings.

And now he had five more potential members.

Young people who loved film. Who understood cinema language. Who'd come to document his theater.

Perfect additions to his permanent collection.

"We're leaving," Kevin said decisively. "Now. I'll reinstall the distributor cap, we pile in the van, we drive. If he tries to stop us, we go through him."

"The perimeter," Lisa said. "When you checked the perimeter this morning. What did you find?"

Kevin and Nathan exchanged looks.

"Evidence he's been watching us," Kevin admitted. "Footprints everywhere. Infrastructure for long-term survival. He knows this place perfectly. Knows how we think."

"Then he knows we'll try to leave," Lisa said. "He's been planning for that. The distributor cap—he took it to show he could stop us whenever he wants. Putting it back doesn't mean we're free. It means he's letting us think we're free."

"So what do you suggest?" Greg demanded. "Stay and wait to be murdered?"

Lisa didn't have an answer. Because every option seemed like playing into Dalton's hands. Leave, and he'd already planned for that. Stay, and they were trapped in his controlled environment. Fight, and they were confronting someone who'd survived eleven years in the desert and killed nine people.

No good options. Only degrees of terrible.

"We need more information," Samantha said. "We need to understand his plan completely. When he intends to act. What triggers him. Whether there's a way to break the delusion."

"How do we get that information?" Greg asked.

"We ask him," Nathan said. "Directly. We initiate contact, on our terms, in a controlled way. Interview him. Document his story. Maybe in telling it, he reveals something we can use."

"Or maybe talking to him makes him decide it's time to add us to the collection," Kevin countered.

They argued, debated, cycled through options. But Lisa wasn't listening anymore. She was thinking about the shrine. Nine faces in an arc, candlelight making them seem almost alive. The way Dalton had arranged them so carefully, with such obvious devotion.

He loved those nine people. In his twisted way, he loved them absolutely.

And love like that didn't let go.

Lisa looked around at her group. Nathan with his camera and obsession. Samantha with her notes and analysis. Kevin with his tactical mind. Greg with his terror and loyalty.

Five new members.

Five new faces for the shrine.

And somewhere in the ruins, Dalton Reed was preparing the next screening.

The one that would make them permanent.
