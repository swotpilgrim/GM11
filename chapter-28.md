# Chapter 28: Completing the Documentary

Two months later—late November 1983—Nathan sat in the university film lab staring at the Steenbeck editing console. *The Last Screening* existed in rough cut form: eighty-seven minutes of footage shaped into narrative, transitions smoothed, audio mixed, the story told from arrival to aftermath.

He'd watched it twelve times now, refining each viewing. And every time, he questioned whether he should actually release it.

The documentary was powerful. Festival programmers would love it—true crime meets supernatural ambiguity meets meditation on obsession and art. Critics would write essays about the ambiguous ending, about whether the film took a stance on the paranormal elements or deliberately withheld judgment.

But it was also exploitative. Two people had died—Dalton Reed and arguably Nathan's own innocence. Turning that into entertainment felt wrong, even if the entertainment claimed to be truth-telling.

A knock on the editing room door. Samantha entered carrying coffee and pastries.

"How's it looking?" she asked, settling into the chair beside him.

"Done. Technically. I could submit it tomorrow." Nathan took the coffee gratefully. "But I don't know if I should."

"Show me."

He cued up the final cut. Samantha watched in silence as the documentary unfolded—their arrival at the Stardust, the mounting strangeness, Dalton's reveal, the confrontation, the fire. Nathan had structured it chronologically with minimal narration, letting the footage speak. The supernatural elements were presented without comment: nine voices on audio, shapes in the smoke, Dalton's conversations with empty air.

The climax was Dalton's final run into the burning booth, the structure collapsing, the pillar of fire rising into desert dawn. Then a coda showing the investigation, the official report, Detective Ruiz explaining the rational interpretation of events.

But the film's final shot was the one frame where the nine silhouettes were clearest—transparent shapes arranged like cars at a drive-in, watching the screen burn. The image held for ten seconds, then faded to black. Credits rolled.

Samantha was silent for a long moment. Then: "It's good. Really good. Unsettling without being exploitative, ambiguous without being wishy-washy. You balanced it."

"But should I release it?"

"That's not a question I can answer." She turned to face him. "What do you want the film to do?"

Nathan thought about that. What was the purpose of documentary? Truth-telling, yes. But also meaning-making. Taking raw experience and shaping it into narrative that helped audiences understand the world.

"I want people to understand what obsession looks like," he said slowly. "How someone can love something so much it destroys them. Dalton Reed loved cinema genuinely—not ironically, not casually, but with complete devotion. And that devotion curdled into madness because he was alone with it for eleven years."

"So the film is about obsession and isolation," Samantha said. "Not about ghosts."

"The ghosts are... secondary. Real or not real, they're what Dalton's isolation created. Whether they had independent existence doesn't change their function in his delusion."

Samantha nodded slowly. "That's your framing. Obsession as horror. Isolation as monster. The paranormal elements become symptoms of Dalton's broken mind rather than literal hauntings."

"Except I can't prove they weren't literal hauntings."

"And you don't need to. Ambiguity is your friend here. Let audiences bring their own interpretations."

Nathan rewound to the section where Dalton talked to Mrs. Morrison about cinematography. Watching it now, with distance from trauma, Nathan could see both readings: a mentally ill man having one-sided conversations, or a man genuinely communicating with spirits. The footage supported either view.

"The Santa Fe Independent Film Festival," Samantha said. "Accepts submissions through December. If you're going to submit somewhere, start there. Small, curated, serious about documentary craft."

Nathan had been thinking the same thing. Santa Fe would take the film seriously, wouldn't turn it into spectacle. And if it screened well there, maybe submit to bigger festivals. Let the documentary find its audience organically.

"I need to show it to the others first," Nathan said. "We agreed—everyone has veto power."

"Kevin will approve it. He'll argue it leans too supernatural, but he'll grudgingly admit you didn't make him look crazy." Samantha smiled. "Lisa will love it. She'll see validation of her experiences. Greg... I don't know. Might depend on his mood."

"And you?"

"I don't have veto power. I love it as is."

Nathan spent another week refining small details. Color correction on the fire sequences to make the flames read properly on film. Audio sweetening to clarify dialogue without removing ambient desert sounds. Title card placement. Credits sequencing.

The film professor whose equipment Nathan had borrowed watched the rough cut and offered notes—mostly pacing suggestions, tightening the middle investigation section. But overall, his feedback was positive.

"This is festival-quality work," Professor Hendricks said. "Technically proficient, narratively compelling, and it raises genuine questions about reality and perception. Submit it."

Nathan burned VHS copies for the other four. Set up a private screening in the film department's small theater. Sent out invitations with a note: *Final cut. Your approval needed before submission.*

They gathered on a Friday evening in late November. Just the five of them in a fifty-seat theater, Nathan's documentary projected on the screen that usually showed Bergman and Godard and other classics of cinema.

He introduced the screening briefly: "This is what we lived. I've tried to show it honestly without sensationalizing. If anyone objects, we bury it. If everyone approves, I submit to Santa Fe."

Then he started playback and left the booth, sitting with the others in the small theater.

Watching the documentary with them was different than watching alone. Nathan heard their breathing catch at certain moments—Greg during the storage room imprisonment, Lisa when Dalton spoke to the nine victims, Kevin during the final confrontation. Shared trauma relived collectively.

The film ended. The nine silhouettes held on screen, then faded. Credits rolled in silence.

Nathan waited.

Kevin spoke first: "You didn't take a position. On whether it was real or delusion."

"I presented what we experienced. How people interpret it is their choice."

"That's cowardly."

"Or honest."

Kevin considered. "Fine. I approve. But I still think you should've included more debunking of the paranormal elements."

"I think it's perfect," Lisa said. "It shows what we felt without telling people they're wrong for believing. I approve."

Greg was quiet longer. Finally: "You made Dalton sympathetic. Not excusable, but... human. I didn't expect that."

"He was human," Nathan said. "Broken and dangerous, but human. Eleven years alone did that to him."

"I approve," Greg said. "But I don't want to watch it again. Once is enough."

Samantha didn't have a vote, but she smiled. "It's good work, Nathan. Really good."

Four approvals. The documentary was cleared for release.

Nathan submitted to Santa Fe Independent Film Festival the next day. Then sat back and waited, trying to focus on his other senior year obligations while *The Last Screening* worked its way through festival bureaucracy.

The acceptance letter came three weeks later, delivered to his campus mailbox on a cold December morning: selected for the Documentary Competition section, scheduled for screening November 19-22, 1984—almost exactly a year after filming. Nathan would have graduated by then, moved on to whatever came next. The documentary would be a capstone on his college career, a calling card for future work, and permanent testament to two days that changed everything.

He called the others to share the news. Mixed reactions—excitement from Samantha and Lisa, apprehension from Kevin and Greg. But they'd all agreed to see this through.

"Just remember," Kevin said, "we're going to be asked about this. Journalists, paranormal investigators, true crime podcasters. Everyone's going to want our story."

"So we tell them what we told the sheriff," Nathan said. "What happened. Let them draw their own conclusions."

But he knew Kevin was right. The documentary would create interest in the real people behind it. They'd become part of the Stardust story, their lives entangled with Dalton Reed's forever.

Some experiences couldn't be left behind. You carried them forward, integrated them, made them part of your narrative.

The Stardust had burned. Dalton had died. Nine victims from 1972 had finally been avenged or joined by their killer, depending on your interpretation.

And five film students had survived to tell the tale.

*The Last Screening* was Nathan's version of that tale. Eighty-seven minutes of truth filtered through camera lenses and editing decisions. Not objective truth—no such thing existed. But honest truth. Witnessed truth.

Whether it included ghosts or just documented delusion, Nathan had stopped trying to definitively answer.

Some mysteries were better left mysterious.

The documentary existed now. It would screen. People would watch. Critics would debate.

And somewhere in the Arizona desert, the Stardust's ruins cooled. Developers had bought the land. Bulldozers would arrive in spring. By summer, the site would be stripped clean, ready for construction.

The drive-in would become a strip mall, just as Dalton had feared.

But the story would survive. The footage would survive.

And whether nine ghosts still watched from empty space, Nathan would leave for others to wonder.

His job was done. The documentary was complete.

Now came the truly hard part: living with what he'd created.
