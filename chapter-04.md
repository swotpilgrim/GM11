# Chapter 4: Equipment Failures

Kevin didn't believe in curses. He believed in systems, mechanics, cause and effect. Two years in the Air Force had trained that into him—troubleshoot methodically, fix the problem. Every malfunction had an explanation.

So when Nathan suggested they approach the projection booth, Kevin grabbed his equipment bag and ran through his mental checklist. Batteries: fully charged before leaving Tucson, tested an hour ago, showing 12.6 volts. Flashlights: Maglites with fresh D-cells. Audio recorder: new tape, clean heads, levels good. Camera: 16mm Bolex with manual everything, mechanical perfection that didn't rely on electronics.

Nothing to go wrong. Just old concrete and broken windows.

"Let's make this quick," he said, leading the way toward the booth platform. "Document the exterior, peek inside if the door's accessible, then back to camp. We're low on generator fuel and I want to preserve batteries for tomorrow."

The wooden stairs creaked under their weight but held. Kevin tested each one before putting his full weight down—construction training from his dad, who'd broken his back on a rotted deck when Kevin was twelve. Never trust wood you haven't inspected.

At the top, the booth door waited. Rusted padlock through a hasp, but when Kevin tugged experimentally, the whole hasp shifted. The screws had rusted through the wood. One good pull would tear it free.

"Door's compromised," he reported. "We could get in if needed."

"Not tonight," Nathan said, filming the door and lock. "Just exterior shots. We'll come back in daylight when we can see what we're doing."

Kevin pulled out his Maglite and clicked it on. The beam cut through darkness, illuminating peeling paint and—

The light died. Just... went out. Full brightness to nothing in an instant.

"Shit," Kevin muttered, smacking the barrel against his palm. Nothing. He unscrewed the head and checked the batteries. They looked fine, seated correctly, but when he touched the positive terminal it was cold. Dead.

"Equipment problems?" Nathan asked.

"Bad batteries, I guess." Kevin pulled fresh ones from his bag and swapped them. Clicked the light on. It worked for maybe three seconds, bright and strong, then faded and died again.

"That's not right," he said. A frown creased his forehead. "These were brand new. Interstate batteries, top of the line."

"Try mine," Greg offered, handing over his flashlight.

Kevin clicked it on. Same thing—worked for a few seconds, then died. He checked Greg's batteries. Stone cold dead.

"Lisa, your light," Kevin said.

She handed it over, expression worried. Kevin didn't even get three seconds this time. The light flickered once and went out, batteries drained to nothing.

"Okay," Kevin said slowly, his troubleshooting mind racing through possibilities. "This isn't normal battery failure. Something's draining them. Electromagnetic interference, maybe. Unshielded wiring in the booth throwing off a field."

"From what power source?" Nathan asked. "This place has been dead for eleven years."

"Residual charge in old wiring. It happens." But even as Kevin said it, he didn't believe it. Electromagnetic drain strong enough to kill batteries in seconds? That would require serious current.

"The camera equipment," Samantha said suddenly. "Check the camera batteries."

Kevin grabbed the battery pack for the main light rig. It had read 12.4 volts fifteen minutes ago. He connected his multimeter and watched the needle.

8.3 volts. Dropping as he watched. 7.9. 7.6.

"That's impossible," he said flatly. "These are sealed lead-acid batteries. They don't drain like this without a load."

"But they are draining," Lisa said quietly.

Kevin disconnected the meter and the drain stopped. The voltage stabilized at 7.1. Still dropping, but slower now. He stood there looking at the equipment, his rational mind trying to process what his instruments were telling him.

"We go back for backups," he decided. "Fresh batteries, different equipment. If it happens again, we're dealing with environmental factors we need to identify."

They descended the stairs and returned to camp. Kevin dug out the backup battery packs—fully charged units they'd kept in reserve. Tested them with the multimeter: 12.8 volts, perfect. He loaded fresh cells in the flashlights, double-checked every connection.

"Alright," he said. "Let's try this again. If the same thing happens, we document it and figure out the pattern."

The walk back to the booth felt longer this time. Kevin's mind ran through scenarios: faulty equipment (but everything had tested fine), environmental interference (but from what source?), equipment sabotage (but by who?). Nothing fit.

At the top of the stairs, he clicked on his flashlight. Bright beam, steady. Thirty seconds. A minute. Still working.

"Okay," he said. "Looks like it was just—"

The light died. Batteries dead again.

Kevin checked the backup battery pack. 4.2 volts and dropping. In the five minutes since he'd tested it, it had lost two-thirds of its charge.

"This doesn't make sense," he said. Not to the group, to himself. "This violates basic thermodynamics. Energy doesn't just disappear."

"Maybe we should come back tomorrow," Greg said. "In daylight. When things work."

Kevin wanted to argue, but Greg had a point. Something about this booth was killing their equipment. Until he understood what, proceeding was irresponsible.

Then Nathan stepped forward and pushed the door.

The rusted hasp tore free with a shriek of metal on wood. The door swung inward on protesting hinges, revealing darkness beyond.

"Nathan, wait—" Kevin started.

But Nathan was already stepping inside, holding up his mechanical Bolex. No electronics, no batteries. Just clockwork and glass.

Kevin grabbed the hand-crank emergency light they'd brought—purely mechanical, no batteries. Cranked the handle and it produced a weak glow. He followed Nathan inside, cranking constantly to maintain light.

The projection booth was smaller than he'd expected. Maybe twelve by fifteen feet, concrete walls on three sides and the screen-facing wall mostly window. The projection equipment dominated the space—a massive carbon-arc projector sitting on a metal stand, reels above and below, the whole mechanism looking like something from a museum.

Dust covered everything. But underneath the dust, Kevin could see the equipment was intact. More than intact—maintained. The projector's mechanism was clean, free of rust. Film reels sat stacked on shelves, canisters hand-labeled in careful script.

The smell hit him next. Dust and concrete, yes, but also smoke—old smoke, like it had seeped into the walls. And something chemical. Sharp and distinctive.

"Nitrate film," Samantha breathed, stepping inside behind them. She'd switched to her mechanical camera too. "Jesus, he's got nitrate stock. That stuff's been banned for decades. Incredibly flammable."

She moved to the shelves, reading labels. "Night of the Scarecrow, 1971. The Kremlin Letter, 1970. These are rare prints. Some of these are probably the only surviving copies."

Kevin moved to the projector, examining it with a technician's eye. The carbon-arc mechanism was complex—two carbon rods that created light through electrical discharge, mirrors to focus and amplify. You needed serious electrical power to run one of these. And serious skill to maintain it.

"How old is this equipment?" he asked.

"1960s, maybe earlier," Samantha said, photographing the reels. "Carbon-arc was standard for drive-ins through the seventies. Bright enough to project on massive screens, but temperamental. Required constant adjustment."

Kevin found the power cables. They'd been cut—roughly, with bolt cutters maybe, the copper wires exposed and corroded. No power had flowed through these lines in years.

But someone had been here. Recently. The dust had been disturbed, footprints visible in the thin layer covering the floor. Barefoot prints, he noted. Large feet, size twelve maybe. The prints circled the room, approached the projector, moved to the shelves.

"Someone's been maintaining this," he said. "Look at the prints. Fresh, maybe days old."

Lisa had stayed near the door, arms wrapped around herself. "Can we please leave?" she asked. Her voice was shaking. "Please. Something's wrong here. I can feel it."

"In a minute," Nathan said, filming everything. "This is incredible. Eleven years abandoned and the equipment's pristine."

Greg had his audio recorder running, headphones on. Kevin watched him adjust levels, his face scrunched in concentration. Then Greg went pale.

He yanked the headphones off.

"There's something on the tape," he said.

"More interference?" Kevin asked.

"No. Listen." Greg rewound and hit play.

Through the small speaker, Kevin heard the sounds of their entry. The door creaking. Nathan's footsteps. Samantha reading film titles. Then, underneath it all, something else.

Breathing. Low and steady, in rhythm with their movements.

Then a voice. Male. Low. Clear as day:

"Get out."

Everyone froze. The recording continued—more breathing, their own voices discussing the projector. Then again:

"Get out. My theater. Get out."

Greg stopped the tape.

"That's impossible," Kevin said automatically. "The recorder wasn't running when we entered. You started it after we came inside."

"I started it when we came up the stairs," Greg said. His hands were shaking. "It's been running the whole time. And I didn't hear anyone speak. Did you?"

Kevin looked at the others. Nathan shook his head. Samantha did the same. Lisa looked like she might cry.

"Play it again," Kevin demanded.

Greg rewound. They listened together. The voice was there, clear and undeniable. Not radio interference or audio artifacts. A human voice, male, speaking directly into the microphone.

But no one had spoken.

"Okay," Kevin said. His mind was racing, looking for rational explanations and finding none. "Okay. There's a recording. Which means someone was here. Is here. Maybe hiding. The voice is coming from somewhere."

"We're standing in an empty room," Nathan said quietly. "There's nowhere to hide."

Kevin spun, examining every corner. Concrete walls, no closets, no crawlspaces. The windows were open to the night—anyone hiding would be visible. The door behind them was the only entrance.

They were alone in the booth.

But someone had spoken into Greg's microphone.

"We're leaving," Kevin said. His training had a protocol for unknown threats: gather intelligence, withdraw, reassess. "Now. Bring the equipment, move quickly, don't run. Back to camp."

For once, no one argued. They filed out of the booth, equipment in hand. Kevin was last, pulling the door closed behind them. As he did, he looked back at the projection booth interior.

In the beam of moonlight coming through the window, he saw the footprints in the dust. Their footprints, five sets leading in and out.

And one more set. Barefoot prints, leading from the corner to the center of the room.

Prints that hadn't been there when they entered.

Kevin slammed the door and descended the stairs fast, not caring if they held. Behind him the booth sat silent and dark, its windows like eyes watching them flee.

His hands were shaking. Kevin Morrison, who didn't believe in ghosts or curses, who believed only in systems and mechanics and cause and effect.

His hands were shaking, and he had no explanation for what he'd just witnessed.

None at all.
