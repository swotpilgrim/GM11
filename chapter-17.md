# Chapter 17: Preparing for Confrontation

Kevin's hands moved with military precision, sorting through equipment scattered across the snack bar floor. Two hours until sunset.

"This one." He hefted an eighteen-inch tire iron, testing its weight. The metal was solid, heavy. He set it aside and picked up a broken speaker post—three feet of rusted metal with a jagged edge. "And this."

"We're really doing this," Greg said from the window, where he'd been chain-smoking for an hour. "We're actually going to walk out there and let a mass murderer show us a movie."

"You have a better idea?" Kevin didn't look up from his inventory. A socket wrench. A hammer. A long screwdriver. Not much, but more than nothing.

"Yeah. We run. Now. Before it gets dark."

"Twenty miles in the desert at night?" Kevin shook his head. "We'd die of exposure before reaching the highway. That's if Dalton doesn't hunt us down first. He knows this terrain. We don't."

Nathan sat at one of the folding tables, checking his camera for the third time. Fresh film stock loaded. Batteries charged. His hands performed familiar motions while his mind raced ahead.

"I'm bringing the camera," he said. "Whatever happens, we document it."

"Document our own deaths," Greg muttered. "Great thesis project."

"Evidence." Samantha looked up from where she'd been wrapping Dalton's journals in Nathan's jacket, creating a makeshift protective bundle. "If something goes wrong, if we don't make it out, someone will find this. The journals, the footage. They'll know what happened here."

The pragmatism in her voice chilled Nathan more than Greg's panic. Samantha was preparing for the worst case scenario with the same methodical attention she'd give to research. Citing sources for her own death.

Lisa sat apart from them, knees pulled to her chest, staring at the wall. She hadn't said more than a dozen words since they'd watched Targets. Nathan wanted to offer comfort, but what could he say? That everything would be okay? They both knew better.

"We need a strategy," Kevin said, standing with the tire iron in one hand. "We can't just walk in there blind."

"What kind of strategy works against a delusional arsonist with a gun?"

"The kind where we stay calm, stay together, and look for opportunities." Kevin's voice carried the authority of training. "Dalton wants something from us. He wants witnesses, an audience. That gives us leverage."

"How?"

"We give him what he wants. We watch his screening, we engage with him, we make him think we're interested. Film people respond to film talk, right?" He looked at Samantha.

She nodded slowly. "Fanatics respond to shared belief. If we can convince him we appreciate what he's doing, that we understand his vision, he might let his guard down."

"Then we run," Kevin finished.

"Or fight," Nathan said quietly.

Everyone looked at him. He met their eyes, feeling the weight of what he'd led them into. His project, his vision, his obsession. And it had brought them here, preparing to face a killer.

"I'm not saying we attack him," Nathan continued. "But if it comes down to survival, if there's no other way out, we use what Kevin's prepared. We fight."

"He's got a gun," Greg said.

"He's also sixty pounds underweight and half crazy from living alone for eleven years." Kevin tapped the tire iron against his palm. "Gun's an advantage, but if we get close, if we can surprise him, we have a chance."

"Listen to us." Lisa's voice was small but clear. "We're planning to attack a man. To hurt him. Maybe kill him."

"A man who murdered nine people," Kevin said. "Who's planning to murder us."

"I know what he is." Lisa looked at them, her dark eyes wet but focused. "I'm not arguing. I'm just... saying it out loud. So we're clear about what we might have to do."

The room fell silent except for the wind and the distant creak of metal speaker posts.

"Here's what we know," Samantha said, shifting into analysis mode. "Dalton's been alone for eleven years. His reality is completely constructed around his delusion—the victims forgave him, they want him to continue showing films, he's preserving something sacred. That delusion is his anchor."

"So we reinforce it or shatter it?" Nathan asked.

"We reinforce it initially. Make him believe we're true cinema lovers, that we get what he's doing. Lower his guard." Samantha's fingers drummed against the table, the way they did when she was working through a theory. "But if we need to break him out of it, shock him back to reality, we attack the delusion directly. Tell him the dead aren't here. That there's no audience. That he's alone and always has been."

"That might make him more dangerous," Greg said.

"Everything makes him more dangerous. We're fucked either way." Samantha's bluntness startled them. She was usually analytical, composed. But that composure was cracking.

Outside, the sun continued its descent. Shadows stretched impossibly long, light turning thick and golden.

Kevin distributed the improvised weapons. The tire iron for himself. The sharpened speaker post for Nathan. The hammer for Greg, who took it reluctantly. "Stay close to me," Kevin told him. "If things go bad, you're backup, not frontline."

"What about us?" Samantha asked.

"You two stay behind us if there's a confrontation. But you're our voices. You do the talking, the engaging. You're the film experts. Make him believe you care."

They spent the next hour reviewing what they knew. The 1972 fire. The nine victims—Kevin ran through their names. Morrison family: Frank, Carol, and their three kids. The Delgados. Rollins and his wife. The teenage concession worker.

"Why not the teenager?" Nathan wondered.

"Maybe he doesn't consider employees part of the audience," Samantha suggested. "Or maybe that death was accidental, collateral damage. His delusion focuses on the viewers."

"The congregation," Lisa said softly.

They talked through conversation topics. Safe subjects that would engage Dalton without triggering rage. Film preservation. The death of drive-in culture. Great directors. The communal experience of cinema versus isolation of home viewing.

"That's his real wound," Samantha said. "Not just what he did, but what the industry did. Abandoned drive-ins for multiplexes and VHS. He sees himself as a martyr for a dying artform."

"And us as witnesses to his martyrdom," Nathan said.

"Or participants in it." Greg's voice was flat. "Nine people died in the original fire. Five of us now. Maybe that's the point. Maybe he's planning a remake."

Nobody had an answer for that.

At 6:30 PM, with the sun touching the western hills, movement caught Kevin's attention through the window. "He's coming out."

They gathered at the window, watching.

Dalton Reed emerged from the projection booth in full daylight for the first time. The distance was considerable—maybe two hundred yards—but Nathan's telephoto lens brought him into sharp focus.

He was skeletal. The tattered projectionist vest hung on his frame like a scarecrow's clothes. Wild gray-streaked hair and beard, both long and tangled. Bare feet, calloused and cracked. He moved with surprising fluidity despite his gaunt appearance, crossing the lot with the familiarity of someone who'd walked this ground thousands of times.

"Look what he's doing," Samantha whispered.

Dalton walked among the speaker posts, weaving between them in a specific pattern. At each post he stopped, pantomiming opening a car door. Then he'd smile, nod, and gesture toward the screen—the universal usher's greeting, showing patrons to their seats.

He was arranging his invisible audience.

Post by post, row by row, he worked across the lot. At some speakers he spent longer, appearing to have conversations with empty air. His mouth moved constantly. Occasionally he laughed, the sound carrying thinly across the desert silence.

"Third row center," Lisa said. "That's where he is now. Mrs. Morrison's favorite spot, from the journals."

Dalton's attention to that particular speaker was elaborate. He pantomimed helping someone from a car, guiding them, perhaps offering a blanket or pillow for comfort. His gestures were tender, solicitous. He appeared to be talking with children, bending down to their level, his expression warm.

"He's seating the Morrison kids," Samantha's voice shook. "The three children he killed."

Nathan filmed it all. The surreal tableau of a madman preparing a theater for ghosts. It was horrifying and tragic in equal measure—a man so broken by guilt and isolation that he'd constructed an entire fantasy world where his victims loved him.

Dalton worked his way back through the rows, checking and rechecking the arrangement. He paused at what must have been Rollins's spot—the back corner, according to the journals. He spent a long moment there, appearing to listen, then nodding. Some exchange between killer and victim, some conversation only he could hear.

Finally, Dalton turned toward the snack bar. Toward them.

He waved.

The gesture was cheerful, welcoming, the friendly wave of a host greeting honored guests. Come on out, the wave said. Everything's ready. The show's about to begin.

"Jesus Christ," Greg breathed.

Dalton stood there for a moment longer, silhouetted against the darkening sky, then turned and walked back to the projection booth. His gait was unhurried, peaceful. A man satisfied with his preparations.

"He's completely gone," Kevin said. "Whatever connection to reality he might have had, it's severed. We're dealing with someone who lives in a completely different world."

"A world where nine dead people come to his screenings every night," Nathan said.

"And tonight he's giving them something special." Samantha hugged herself, despite the lingering desert heat. "Us."

The sun touched the horizon, spilling red light across the scrubland. In the projection booth, lights came on. Dalton was preparing the equipment, threading film, running pre-show checks. Everything had to be perfect for his premiere.

Nathan looked at his friends—Kevin checking the tire iron one more time, Greg pale and shaking, Samantha gripping the bundled journals like a talisman, Lisa staring at nothing with the stillness of someone in shock.

Two days ago they'd been film students on a documentary shoot. Now they were preparing to face a killer in his own temple, to sit through a screening that might be their last.

"It's time," Kevin said as the sun dropped below the hills and the desert transformed from gold to purple. "We stay together. We stay smart. And we survive this."

Nathan picked up his camera. The weight was familiar, comforting. He'd document this the way he'd documented everything else—with attention to composition, to light, to truth. Even if the truth was terrible.

They walked to the door.

Outside, the first stars were appearing in the darkening sky. The projection booth glowed warm and inviting. Somewhere in that light, Dalton Reed was waiting for his audience to arrive.

The show was about to begin.

And there was no way to know how it would end.
