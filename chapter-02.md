# Chapter 2: Setting Up Camp

The generator coughed to life on Kevin's third pull, settling into a steady rumble that violated the desert silence. He positioned it outside, running extension cords through a broken window.

"We've got six hours of fuel," he announced. "After that we're on battery packs and moonlight."

"Six hours is plenty," Nathan said, organizing the film equipment with surgical care. "We'll shoot in intervals. Conserve batteries."

Kevin started rigging work lights with methodical efficiency—testing connections, securing cables. Military training showed in small ways: economy of movement, constant threat assessment.

Samantha sat cross-legged near the counter, surrounded by research. Newspaper clippings in chronological order, photocopies from microfiche, notes in cramped handwriting.

"Okay," Nathan said, settling across from her. "Walk me through it."

Lisa joined them, camera around her neck. Greg stayed by the door smoking, watching the lot. The sunset's orange had faded to purple and gray.

Samantha pulled out a clipping—the Arizona Daily Star, October 21, 1972. Front page. FIRE AT DRIVE-IN KILLS NINE. Below it, a photo of the Stardust lot with emergency vehicles, smoke still rising from the ruined projection booth.

"October 20th, 1972," she began. "Friday night. Double feature showing—The Godfather and Deliverance. Prime spot in the schedule, both recent releases. The lot was maybe half full, about eighty cars. First film started at 8:15."

"Who were the victims?" Lisa asked softly.

Samantha had arranged their photos in a row. Nine faces cut from newspapers, most from obituary pages. "The Morrison family. David and Ellen, parents. Three kids—Michael, eight. Sarah, six. Tommy, three." She touched each photo. "Station wagon, center of the lot."

Nathan felt something tighten in his chest. Three kids.

"The Delgados. Roberto and Maria, newlyweds. This was their special place." Samantha's voice had gone flat. "Jack Rollins, fifty-eight, owner. His wife Barbara, fifty-six. They were doing inventory. And Timothy Walsh, seventeen, concession employee."

Nine people. Nine lives. Nathan looked at their faces arranged on the dusty floor and felt the weight of what they were documenting. This wasn't just abandoned architecture. This was a mass grave with a view of the stars.

"The fire started at 9:47," Samantha said. "During the intermission between films. Witnesses reported seeing flames in the projection booth window. Within minutes it had spread to the roof, then started dropping burning debris onto the lot below."

"How did they die?" Nathan asked.

"Morrison family—smoke inhalation. They were asleep in their car, kids in the back seat. Never woke up. The Delgados tried to run. Burns and smoke. Rollins and his wife were trapped in the office when the roof collapsed. Walsh was overcome trying to help people evacuate."

The room was quiet except for the generator's rumble outside. Kevin had finished with the lights and stood listening, arms crossed. Lisa had tears on her cheeks but made no sound.

"The investigation found accelerant," Samantha continued. "Five gallons of gasoline in the projection booth, ignition point near the film storage. Arson, no question. And the projectionist—Dalton Reed—vanished before the fire department arrived."

She pulled out another clipping. A single photograph: employee ID badge from 1971. Dalton Reed, age 42. Thin face, dark hair slicked back, intense stare that seemed to look through the camera rather than at it. Clean-shaven, wearing the maroon vest that marked him as staff.

"He'd worked here since 1965," Samantha said. "Seven years. Started as assistant projectionist, promoted after the first guy quit. By all accounts he was brilliant with the equipment. Could fix anything, knew the mechanics inside and out. But he was strange."

"Strange how?" Nathan asked.

"Obsessive. Territorial about the booth—wouldn't let anyone else touch the equipment. Got angry when customers talked during films, even though they were in soundproof cars. One employee said Reed would watch the lot during screenings with binoculars, like he was monitoring everyone."

"That's not strange," Greg said from the doorway. "That's fucking creepy."

"There's more," Samantha said. "Rollins—the owner—he treated Reed like garbage. Multiple former employees confirmed it. Paid him almost nothing. Blamed him publicly when equipment failed, even though Reed was maintaining machines from the 1950s with no budget for parts. Humiliated him in front of customers."

"Motive," Kevin said.

"Clear motive," Samantha agreed. "The police theory was Reed snapped after years of abuse. Planned the fire to kill Rollins, didn't care about collateral damage. He set it during intermission when he knew where everyone would be, then vanished. Some thought he died in the desert. Others said he made it to Mexico."

Nathan studied the photograph of Dalton Reed. There was something in those eyes—not evil exactly, but disconnected. Like he was seeing something the rest of the world couldn't.

"No body was ever found?" he asked.

"No. Manhunt lasted three weeks, then went cold. Officially still wanted for nine counts of murder, but presumed dead as of 1974." Samantha paused. "Unofficially... there were rumors."

"What kind of rumors?" Lisa asked.

"Sightings. 1975, a scarecrow figure scavenging behind a grocery store in Tucson at 3 AM. 1978, someone breaking into the university film library, stealing reels. Nothing confirmed. Could be urban legend. Could be..." She gestured at the ruins surrounding them.

Kevin walked to the window, looking out at the lot. Full darkness now, speaker posts barely visible. "If he's alive, he's not here. We'd have seen evidence."

"Maybe," Nathan said. But he thought about the projection booth. They hadn't been inside yet.

Greg lit another cigarette. His hands shook slightly. "My grandfather knew him. Dalton. Said he was smart. Could talk about film like college professors. But he had this look, like he wasn't really there. Like he was always watching something nobody else could see."

"Your grandfather told you not to come here," Lisa said gently.

"Yeah." Greg took a long drag. "He said some places remember violence. Said nine people died screaming and the desert doesn't forget that. Said Dalton loved this place more than any person and love like that doesn't die." He laughed, but it had no humor. "Old man superstition, right?"

Nobody answered.

Kevin checked his watch—a digital Casio that glowed green in the dimming light. "We should eat something before we start shooting. Keep energy up."

They heated canned soup on the Coleman stove, passing around a box of crackers and sharing warm beers from the cooler. Nathan had brought a cassette player and someone put in a tape—Tom Petty, "Damn the Torpedoes." The music felt like an intrusion at first, too loud and alive for this dead place. But it pushed back the silence, made the generator's rumble less oppressive.

Lisa went out with her camera to catch the last of twilight. Nathan watched through the window as she framed shots of the screen against the deepening blue sky, moving with unconscious grace. She felt things the rest of them intellectualized. Saw beauty in decay where he saw symbols and Samantha saw historical patterns.

"You think we'll find anything worth the risk?" Kevin asked quietly, standing next to Nathan.

"We're already finding it," Nathan said. "Look at this." He gestured at Samantha's research, the photos of victims, the timeline. "Nobody's documented this properly. It's just... forgotten. Soon they'll bulldoze it for a strip mall and it'll be gone completely."

"Maybe that's okay," Kevin said. "Maybe some things should be forgotten."

"Nothing should be forgotten. Especially not nine people who died."

"We're not honoring them by camping in the place they were murdered, Nathan. We're exploiting it."

The words landed hard because Nathan had been thinking the same thing. Was this documentary really about preservation? Or was it about his thesis, his career, his romantic notion of himself as an artist documenting America's decay?

Before he could answer, Greg's audio equipment squealed with feedback. He jerked back from it, yanking the headphones off.

"The hell was that?" he demanded.

"Interference," Kevin said, moving to check the equipment. "You're probably picking up the generator or the work lights."

Greg shook his head. "I had it filtered. This was something else. Like... voices."

Kevin plugged in the headphones and listened. His frown deepened. He adjusted settings, checked connections, listened again. "There's something on the recording," he admitted. "Could be radio interference. Truck stop's only ten miles away—CB radios, that kind of thing."

"Play it back," Samantha said.

Greg rewound the tape to where he'd been recording ambient sound before the feedback hit. They gathered around as he pressed play, the reel-to-reel's speaker crackling to life.

At first just wind. The whistle of air through the speaker posts. Then, underneath—something else. A low murmur, like distant conversation. No words clear enough to make out, but the rhythm of human speech. Multiple voices overlapping.

Then a burst of static, and in the static, something that might have been laughter.

The tape ran out. Greg stopped it.

"Radio interference," Kevin said firmly.

"From where?" Greg demanded. "There's nothing out here."

"Highway traffic. Atmospheric conditions bouncing signals. It's a desert at night—weird shit happens with sound."

"You're sure?" Lisa asked. She'd come back inside without anyone noticing.

Kevin met her eyes. "I'm sure there's a rational explanation."

Which wasn't the same as being sure it was radio interference. Nathan noticed the distinction. He suspected Lisa did too.

The temperature had dropped into the fifties now. They pulled on jackets and flannel shirts, preparing for the night shoot. Nathan sketched out a plan—establishing shots of the lot and structures, then longer atmospheric takes. Save the projection booth for tomorrow in daylight when they could see what they were doing.

"We stick together," Kevin said. It wasn't a suggestion. "Nobody wanders off. We're in unfamiliar terrain in the dark. If you get hurt, we're thirty minutes from help even if we can reach a phone."

"Agreed," Nathan said. "Buddy system. Samantha, you're with me. Lisa, stay with Greg. Kevin, you float and monitor audio."

They gathered their equipment and stepped out into the desert night. Above them, the Milky Way sprawled across the sky, so bright it cast shadows. The air smelled like creosote and cooling stone.

The Stardust waited in the darkness, patient and still.

And somewhere in that darkness, something waited with it.
