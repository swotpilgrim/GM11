# Chapter 7: The Decision to Stay

They made it halfway across the lot before Nathan stopped.

"Wait," he said.

Kevin turned, impatient. The sun was fully up now, the desert bright and exposed. Every instinct told him to keep moving, get to the van, drive away from this place. But Nathan had stopped, staring at the film canisters in his bag.

"We need to review the footage," Nathan said.

"In the van," Kevin countered. "While we drive. We're leaving."

"No, now. Before we go. I need to see what we captured." Nathan's eyes had that obsessive gleam Kevin had learned to recognize. The look that said Nathan had latched onto something and wouldn't let go.

"Nathan, there's a man out here who killed nine people—"

"And we have him on film," Nathan interrupted. "Maybe. The shadow in the booth window, the figure we saw. If it's on the footage, it's evidence. Real evidence, not just our word."

"Which we can review after we're somewhere safe," Greg said. He kept glancing at the projection booth, like expecting Dalton to appear in the window.

"It'll take twenty minutes," Nathan insisted. "We set up the Steenbeck, review the footage systematically, see what we actually captured. If there's nothing, fine, we leave. But if there's something—"

"If there's something, it confirms a dangerous person is here and we should leave faster," Kevin finished.

Samantha was nodding though. "He's right. We should know what we have. Documentary evidence of someone living in an abandoned drive-in, projecting films... that's not just a story anymore. That's news. Police will take it seriously if we have footage."

"Police will take it seriously if we tell them we watched a film play by itself and found a living space in the booth," Lisa said quietly. "We don't need footage for that."

"Yes, we do," Nathan said. "Without evidence, it sounds insane. Nine-dead horror movie projectionist living in the ruins? That's the kind of thing cops dismiss as drug-addled kids making up stories. But film evidence? That they can't ignore."

Kevin wanted to argue, but Nathan had a point. Their story sounded impossible. Equipment failure, spontaneous film screening, voices on audio. Without documentation, it was just five college kids claiming to have seen ghosts.

"Twenty minutes," Kevin said finally. "We review the footage, we document what we have, then we leave whether we find anything or not. Agreed?"

Nathan nodded quickly. "Agreed."

They returned to the snack bar. Kevin locked the door again and wedged the chair, knowing it was futile but needing the gesture. Greg started a pot of coffee on the camping stove—the last of their supplies. Lisa sat by the window, watching the lot.

Nathan set up the Steenbeck viewer and began threading the film from last night's shooting. The mechanical viewer clicked and whirred, pulling the 16mm footage through the gate. Kevin watched over his shoulder, seeing their work play out in miniature.

The screen. The speaker posts. The tracking shot down the lot. All normal, all as expected.

"There," Samantha said suddenly. "Back it up."

Nathan reversed the film. The tracking shot again, speaker posts passing by in reverse.

"Slow it down," Samantha said. "Frame by frame."

Nathan advanced the film manually. Click. Speaker post. Click. Empty space. Click. Speaker post. Click—

A figure in the background. Tall and thin, barely visible against the screen. Standing motionless about sixty yards away, watching.

"Holy shit," Greg breathed.

Nathan marked the timestamp on his log sheet and kept advancing. The figure was visible for eight frames—less than a second at normal speed—then gone. Disappeared into shadow.

"Keep going," Samantha said.

They found the figure again in the playground footage. Background, nearly invisible, just a darker shape against the jungle gym. Nathan hadn't seen it while shooting. None of them had. But the camera had captured it.

Again in the footage of the snack bar exterior. Standing by the far speaker posts, maybe forty yards away. Watching.

They went through all the footage systematically, Nathan marking each appearance. By the time they finished, they'd found the figure in fourteen separate shots. Different positions, different backgrounds. Always distant, always watching, never approaching.

Nathan spread out the log sheet, mapping the figure's positions by timestamp. The pattern was clear—he'd been circling them, using the speaker posts and structures for cover, tracking their movements.

"He was right there," Lisa said, her voice hollow. "The whole time, right there, and we never saw him."

"The camera sees differently than the human eye," Nathan said, but his hands were shaking as he wrote. "We were focused on our subjects. The camera captured everything."

Samantha examined one of the clearest frames—the figure visible in profile. "Tall. Maybe six-two, six-three. Extremely thin. Dark clothing, ragged. Barefoot."

"Matches the footprints in the booth," Kevin said.

Nathan reversed the film to the clearest shot and froze it. The figure was small in the frame, maybe thirty yards from the camera, but the profile was distinct. Gaunt to the point of emaciation. Long hair, unkempt. Clothing that might once have been a uniform.

"Dalton Reed," Nathan said quietly. "Has to be. Who else would it be?"

"A squatter. Urban explorer. Drug addict using the location—" Greg started, but his heart wasn't in it. They'd all seen the evidence. The logbook, the living space, the meticulous maintenance of the projector. This wasn't some random homeless person. This was someone who'd lived here for years, someone with purpose and obsession.

"So we have him on film," Kevin said. "Great. Evidence for the police. Now we leave."

"Or we stay," Nathan said.

Everyone turned to stare at him.

"Are you out of your mind?" Greg demanded. "We just confirmed there's a murderer watching us—"

"We confirmed there's a person here. We don't know he's dangerous."

"He burned nine people alive!"

"Eleven years ago, in what may have been a mental breakdown," Nathan argued. "Since then, what's he done? Lived in the booth, maintained the equipment, projected films for... for whatever audience he sees. He hasn't hurt us. Hasn't even approached us directly. Just... watched."

"And played a film for us," Samantha added. "An invitation, maybe. Or a performance."

"You're both crazy," Greg said flatly. "This is insane. Kevin, tell them."

Kevin was silent, thinking. His tactical mind weighed the situation. Dalton Reed—if it was him—had multiple opportunities to attack. They'd been scattered across the lot filming, vulnerable. They'd entered his living space. He could have ambushed them in the booth, in the snack bar, anywhere. But he hadn't.

"What exactly are you proposing?" Kevin asked Nathan.

"We stay today. Document more systematically. Try to make contact, maybe. Interview him if he's willing. Get his story." Nathan's eyes were bright with possibility. "This isn't just a documentary about a dead drive-in anymore. This is about a man who's lived alone for over a decade, maintaining this place like a shrine. That's... that's an incredible story."

"That's exploitation," Lisa said quietly. "He's mentally ill. Using him for your documentary is wrong."

"Telling his story is wrong? Giving him a voice?"

"He had a voice," Greg said. "He used it to plan a mass murder."

"People can change," Nathan insisted. "And we don't know what really happened that night. The official story, the investigation—it happened right after the fire, everyone in shock. Reed never got a trial, never explained himself. What if there's more to it?"

"There's always more to it," Kevin said. "Abused by his employer, mental illness, desperation. That doesn't excuse killing people."

"I'm not excusing it. I'm saying his story deserves to be told. The whole story. And we're in a position to tell it."

Kevin studied Nathan. He saw the ambition there, the hunger for a story that would make his career. But he also saw genuine curiosity, the documentarian's need to understand. Nathan wasn't just exploiting Dalton Reed. He wanted to know what drove a man to live in ruins for eleven years.

"If we stay," Kevin said slowly, "we do it my way. We stay in groups, minimum two people at all times. We maintain watch rotations. We keep the van accessible and fueled, engine facing out, ready to drive. We don't enter enclosed spaces without backup. And if Reed approaches, we don't engage without a clear exit route."

"Tactical protocols," Nathan said, nodding. "I can work with that."

"I can't," Greg said. He stood, grabbing his jacket. "This is insane. All of you have lost your minds. I'm walking to the highway, I'm calling the police, and I'm telling them exactly what's here. You all can stay and get yourselves killed if you want."

"Greg—" Nathan started.

"No." Greg cut him off. "You're my friend, Nathan. You're all my friends. But this is wrong. Staying here with a killer because you want a good thesis story? That's not just stupid, it's suicidal."

He headed for the door. Kevin didn't stop him. It was his choice, his right. But when Greg put his hand on the doorknob, he paused.

Outside, visible through the broken window, a figure stood by the van.

Dalton Reed. Gaunt and ragged, matted hair down to his shoulders, wearing the ruins of a projectionist's uniform. He stood maybe twenty feet from the van, not touching it, just standing there. Looking at the snack bar.

Looking at them.

Everyone froze.

Reed didn't move. Didn't speak. Just stood there in the morning sunlight, watching the building with that intense stare Nathan had seen in the photographs.

"Okay," Greg said quietly, stepping back from the door. "Okay. Not walking out there alone."

They watched Reed through the window. He stood motionless for nearly a minute. Then, slowly, deliberately, he raised one hand. Not waving. Not threatening. Just... acknowledging. An old-fashioned gesture, like a butler greeting arriving guests.

Then he turned and walked toward the screen, disappearing behind it.

"He knows we're here," Lisa whispered. "He knows we're watching."

"He's always known," Samantha said. "That's the point. We're his audience now."

Nathan was already at his camera, double-checking the film stock. "We're staying," he said. "All of us. At least until we understand what's happening here."

Greg opened his mouth to argue, then closed it. The keys were in Nathan's pocket. The van was across twenty yards of open ground where Dalton Reed had just been standing. Walking to the highway meant ten miles of desert alone.

They were committed now, whether by choice or circumstance.

The Stardust Drive-In had them.

And somewhere in the ruins, Dalton Reed was preparing his next screening.
