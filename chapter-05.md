# Chapter 5: The Film Plays

They huddled in the back room, rattled and exhausted. Nathan loaded footage into the Steenbeck viewer, hands shaking. The mechanical whir felt comforting after the booth.

"We should leave," Greg said for the third time. He'd been chain-smoking, the room hazy. "Pack up, drive out tonight."

"After what?" Kevin demanded. "Equipment malfunction? We don't abandon shoots for technical problems."

"That wasn't technical—"

"Explainable," Kevin interrupted. "We haven't found the explanation yet."

Nathan threaded film through the viewer. The footage played—screen in moonlight, speaker posts, tracking shot. Normal. Real.

Samantha reviewed her notes. Lisa curled in the corner, jacket pulled tight. Unease sat in all their stomachs.

"Tomorrow we do a full equipment diagnostic," Kevin said. "Test everything in controlled conditions. Battery drain that severe requires a source. We find it, we understand it."

"And the voice on the recording?" Nathan asked quietly.

Kevin's jaw tightened. "Audio artifact. Interference. Something."

"You don't believe that."

"I believe there's an explanation."

The lights in the projection booth came on.

Everyone froze. Nathan looked up from the viewer, through the broken window toward the lot. The booth's windows glowed yellow-white—the distinctive quality of carbon-arc projection light.

"No," Lisa whispered.

The projector's mechanical clatter carried across the desert silence. Loud, rhythmic, unmistakable. Reels turning, film threading through gates, the whole ancient mechanism coming to life.

A beam of light shot from the projection window, cutting through the darkness. Dust particles swirled in it, making the beam visible like a solid thing. It hit the massive screen fifty yards away.

Images flickered to life. Film leader countdown. 5... 4... 3... 2...

Then a title card in vintage typography: "Night of the Scarecrow" (1971)

"Jesus Christ," Samantha breathed.

Kevin was already moving, sprinting out the door toward the booth. Nathan grabbed the Bolex—manual, no batteries to fail—and followed. The others came behind, drawn by horror and fascination.

The film played on the screen. Clear picture, full color despite the age of the print. Opening credits over a shot of cornfields at dusk. The sound came from the speaker posts—dead speakers that hadn't worked in eleven years, now broadcasting dialogue and score across the lot.

Kevin hit the booth stairs at a run, taking them two at a time. Nathan filmed everything—the lit booth, the beam of light, the image on screen. His documentarian instincts had taken over, even as his heart hammered against his ribs.

"The door's locked!" Kevin shouted down. He was pulling at the handle, throwing his weight against it. "Locked from the inside!"

Nathan reached the platform. The door was definitely locked, the handle refusing to turn. Through the window he could see inside—the projector running, reels turning smoothly, light blazing from the carbon arc. But no one visible. No operator standing at the machine.

"Someone's in there," Kevin insisted, pounding on the door. "Open up! This isn't funny!"

No response. Just the steady clatter of the projector and the sound bleeding from the speakers: A woman's scream. Ominous music. Dialogue about something in the cornfield.

Nathan filmed through the window. The projector ran itself, perfectly threaded and focused. Film fed from the upper reel through the gate and spooled onto the lower reel. The carbon-arc mechanism glowed brilliant white-hot, mirrors directing the light through the lens.

No hands adjusting it. No figure in the booth. Just machinery operating as if invisible hands controlled it.

"This is impossible," Kevin said. His voice had lost its certainty. "There's no power. The cables are cut. The carbon arc requires massive current. This can't be running."

But it was.

Below, Nathan could see the others gathered near the screen, staring up at it. The film played on—a horror movie from 1971, something about a scarecrow that killed people. The kind of low-budget schlock that drive-ins had survived on.

Samantha's voice drifted up: "This is the uncut version! I saw references to it in the film registry. Only three prints existed, all lost in studio fires. This shouldn't exist!"

Nathan kept filming, capturing everything. The booth, the projector through the window, the beam of light, the screen. Evidence. Documentation. Proof that something impossible was happening.

Lisa screamed.

Nathan spun, camera still running. She was pointing at the projection booth window—the side window, not the one they were looking through. Nathan moved around the platform, filming.

For three, maybe four seconds, something blocked the projection light.

A silhouette. Human-shaped. Tall and thin, standing between the projector and the window. The shadow fell across the beam, creating a double-exposure effect on the screen—the film's images overlaid with the silhouette of a man.

Then it moved away and the image cleared.

"There's someone in there," Nathan said. His mouth was dry. "Kevin, we saw someone."

"It's a trick," Kevin insisted, but his voice shook. "Mirrors, pre-set timer, remote control—"

"With what power?" Nathan demanded. "You said it yourself, there's no current!"

The film played on. On screen, the scarecrow stalked through corn rows toward an unsuspecting victim. The score built tension. The woman on screen turned, saw it, opened her mouth to scream—

The film stopped.

Just stopped, mid-frame. The woman's face frozen in terror on the massive screen. The projector's clatter ceased. The lights in the booth went dark, carbon arc extinguishing with an audible pop that echoed across the lot.

Silence. Total and complete. Even the wind through the speaker posts had stopped.

Nathan's camera was the only sound, its mechanical whir suddenly loud in the quiet.

Then the screen went dark as the frozen frame faded, the last light disappearing. The projection booth was black again, windows empty. The speaker posts silent.

It was over. Ten minutes, maybe less. A short film screening in an abandoned drive-in at two in the morning.

"What the fuck," Greg said from below. "What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck—"

"Everyone back to camp," Kevin ordered. His command voice, the one from military training. "Now. Together. Move."

They descended the stairs in a cluster, nobody wanting to be last. Nathan kept filming until they reached the snack bar, then lowered the camera. His arms were shaking.

Inside, they gathered in silence. Samantha pulled out her notes with trembling hands. Greg lit another cigarette, the lighter flame unsteady. Lisa was crying quietly, tears streaming down her face. Kevin paced, hands clenched into fists.

"Okay," Nathan said finally. "Okay. What just happened?"

"We're leaving," Greg said. "Right fucking now. Pack the equipment, get in the van, drive away. This place is wrong."

"Someone's here," Kevin said. "Physical presence. Human operator. Has to be. The equipment can't run itself."

"We were at the door," Nathan countered. "You tried to force it. It was locked from inside. No one could have gotten out."

"There's another exit. Has to be. Hidden door, crawlspace, something. No one could operate that projector remotely. It requires manual threading, focus adjustment, arc maintenance. Someone was in that booth."

"We saw the shadow," Lisa said. Her voice was small. "In the window. Someone was there."

Samantha was flipping through her notes. "Night of the Scarecrow. 1971. Directed by Jerry Thornton, produced by Hemisphere Pictures. Low-budget horror. The uncut version was pulled after test screenings because of violence concerns. All known prints were destroyed." She looked up. "That film shouldn't exist. And we just watched it."

"Maybe it's a different print," Kevin said. "Bootleg, later cut—"

"I know film," Samantha interrupted. "I've read the production history. That was the uncut version. Original color timing, pre-censorship edit. It doesn't exist anymore. Except apparently it does, in that projection booth."

Nathan played back the footage he'd shot. The booth lighting up, the beam hitting the screen, the title card. Through the camera's eye it looked exactly as it had in person—no tricks, no edits, just impossible reality.

"Someone's been living here," he said slowly. "Maintaining the equipment. Collecting rare films. And tonight they... what? Put on a show for us?"

"Why?" Lisa asked. "Why would someone do that?"

Nathan thought about the logbook they'd found. Screening schedules running from 1972 to 1983. Films "played for the audience." The shrine with nine victims' photos.

"Because this is what he does," Nathan said. "Dalton Reed. He's been here for eleven years, and he's still running shows."

"Dalton Reed is dead," Kevin said flatly. "Or in Mexico. Or anywhere but a condemned drive-in. People don't live in ruins for eleven years projecting films for no one."

"We just watched him do exactly that," Samantha said.

"We watched a film play. We don't know who started it."

"Then we find out," Nathan said. "Tomorrow, daylight, we search the booth properly. Find the hidden exit, the power source, the explanation. Document everything. Figure out what's really happening."

"Or we leave," Greg said. "Drive to Tucson, tell the police someone's squatting here. Let them handle it."

Nathan looked around the group. Lisa terrified. Greg desperate to flee. Samantha fascinated despite her fear. Kevin's rationality cracking under inexplicable evidence.

And himself, Nathan thought. What was he? The documentarian who'd put them all in danger for his thesis? The romantic who'd wanted to capture America's decay and found something that wouldn't stay buried?

"We vote," he said. "Stay and investigate, or leave and call authorities. Majority rules."

"Stay," Samantha said immediately.

"Leave," Greg said.

"Leave," Lisa whispered.

Everyone looked at Kevin. He stood at the window, staring out at the dark lot where the projection booth waited.

"We're being watched," he said quietly. "Right now. Someone's out there, and they know we're in here. They played that film specifically for us. An invitation or a warning, I don't know which." He turned to face them. "But if we run now, we learn nothing. And I need to understand this."

"Stay?" Nathan asked.

Kevin nodded reluctantly. "Until dawn. We investigate in daylight, we document what we find, then we leave. But we don't sleep. We maintain watch, we stay together, and at first light we get answers."

Three to two. They were staying.

Greg laughed bitterly. "We're going to die here. You know that, right? This is how people die in horror movies. They stay when they should run."

"This isn't a horror movie," Nathan said.

"No," Greg said, gesturing at the dark lot outside. "It's worse. Because that actually happened."

Nathan had no answer for that. Because Greg was right. That had actually happened. The film had played itself, the projector had run without power, and someone—or something—had put on a show just for them.

The Stardust Drive-In had an audience again.

And the projectionist was still running screenings.
