# Chapter 18: The Screening Begins

The walk across the drive-in lot felt like crossing a threshold into another world. Nathan led with camera and sharpened speaker post. Behind him, Samantha clutched the bundled journals. Kevin moved with tactical awareness, tire iron ready. Greg and Lisa brought up the rear.

The sun had set completely. Stars scattered across the desert sky in impossible profusion, the Milky Way luminous overhead. Absolute darkness, broken only by the projection booth glowing like a lighthouse, yellow light spilling from its windows.

As they approached, Nathan made out details that stopped him cold.

Folding chairs. Six of them, arranged in a neat row near where the concession stand had been. Clean folding chairs that hadn't been there an hour ago.

"He set up seats for us," Samantha whispered.

The chairs faced the massive screen, positioned for optimal viewing. Five chairs together, then a sixth set slightly apart. The empty seat.

Dalton Reed stepped out from behind the concession building.

In the projection booth's backwash light, Nathan got his first clear look at the man who'd been haunting them. Skeletal—140 pounds on a six-foot frame. But he'd cleaned himself. Gray-streaked hair slicked back, beard combed. The faded projectionist vest had been brushed. He wore it like vestments.

Barefoot, his feet dark and cracked from years of desert ground. But he stood straight, dignified, every inch the professional showman.

"Welcome!" His voice was cultured, warm, an announcer from another era. "I'm so glad you could join us tonight."

He approached with arms spread. Nathan's hand tightened on the speaker post, but Dalton made no threatening moves. Just gracious hospitality.

"Please, come in. The evening is perfect for a screening—not too warm, and the stars..." He gestured to the sky. "The stars provide their own ambiance. Nature's marquee."

Nathan found his voice. "Thank you for inviting us."

Play along. Make him believe you care. That was the plan.

Dalton beamed. "The pleasure is mine. It's been so long since we've had...well, new faces. The regulars are wonderful, of course. Faithful. But new blood brings fresh perspective, yes?"

He was already doing it—speaking as if the dead were present. The regulars. The faithful.

"You've maintained all this equipment yourself?"

"For eleven years. Every night, every screening. The projector is a 1965 Strong Super Simplex with a carbon arc lamp. Magnificent machine. They don't make them like this anymore. Everything's xenon now, no soul." He shook his head. "But I've kept her running. Proper maintenance, proper respect for the equipment."

He gestured toward the chairs. "Please, sit. We have a full house tonight."

Nathan looked at the empty lot. Speaker posts and cracked asphalt and darkness. No cars. No people. Nothing.

Dalton saw his expression and smiled. "They're already here. Arrived twenty minutes ago. The Morrisons are always punctual—Frank was in the military, you know. Punctuality was sacred to him."

He pointed to empty space fifteen yards to their right. "Third row, center. That's their spot. Every Friday night for seven years." His voice carried affection. "The children are excited about tonight's selection. It's a Roeg film—Don't Look Now. Have you seen it?"

"I have," Samantha said carefully. "1973, starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. Venice setting."

"Exactly!" Dalton's enthusiasm ignited. "A masterwork of atmospheric horror. Roeg understands that true fear comes from dislocation, from the uncanny. The way he intercuts time and memory, it's revolutionary. And the Venice photography—oh, the use of red as a motif. Brilliant."

He was lecturing now, articulate and passionate. For a moment, Nathan could see who Dalton had been before the fire. A man who genuinely loved cinema, who understood it as art.

Then Dalton turned toward another patch of empty ground. "The Delgados are here as well. Miguel and Rosa. They don't speak much English, but they appreciate good filmmaking. Visual storytelling transcends language, yes?"

"Yes," Nathan agreed, because what else could he say?

Dalton continued his introductions to thin air. "And of course, Mr. Rollins is here." He gestured to the back of the lot, to a speaker post that stood alone. "He prefers the back row now. Keeps to himself. Still processing what happened, I think. Guilt can be such a burden."

The irony of a mass murderer talking about someone else's guilt was staggering.

"Come, sit." Dalton ushered them toward the folding chairs. "We'll begin in just a few minutes. I need to finish the pre-show checks."

They moved to the chairs. Nathan took the center seat, flanked by Samantha and Kevin. Greg and Lisa sat on the ends, leaving the sixth chair empty.

Dalton noticed. "Oh, that one's for Mr. Rollins. He used to own this place. Before he made some very poor decisions." Dalton's voice hardened slightly, then smoothed. "But we've forgiven him. He understands now."

He hurried toward the projection booth: "The film begins in five minutes! Help yourself to refreshments."

There was, of course, no popcorn. No concession stand. Just Dalton's gesture toward where it used to be.

As soon as he disappeared into the booth, Kevin leaned close. "He's completely delusional. This isn't playacting. He genuinely believes they're here."

"Nine people," Lisa whispered. "He's introduced us to nine people who aren't here."

"The nine he killed," Samantha confirmed. "Every single victim. He's constructed a complete fantasy where they forgave him, where they come back every night, where he's still serving them."

The projection booth hummed to life. Film threading through sprockets, the warm-up whine of the carbon arc lamp, the thrum of cooling fans. Mechanical sounds Nathan recognized from film school. Period-authentic sounds.

"Look." Greg pointed to the speaker posts.

Sound was coming through them. Faint, crackling, but unmistakable—the ambient noise of a theater before the show. The murmur of conversation, a child laughing, someone coughing. Audience sounds from a audience that wasn't there.

"That's on his audio playback," Kevin said, forcing rationality. "He's playing a recording to enhance the illusion."

But the sounds weren't coming from any visible speakers. The posts themselves were rusted silent, their wiring long since rotted away. Yet the sounds emanated from them, as if the drive-in itself remembered what it had been.

The projection beam lanced out, hitting the massive screen in a rectangle of brilliant light. Title cards appeared, white text on black:

TONIGHT'S FEATURE PRESENTATION
DON'T LOOK NOW
DIRECTED BY NICOLAS ROEG
1973

Nathan raised his camera and began filming. Document everything. That was his job. The screen, the empty lot, the impossible sound drifting from dead speakers.

Dalton's voice came through the speaker system, professional and practiced: "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Stardust Drive-In. Tonight we're pleased to present a modern masterpiece of psychological horror. I ask that you please remain in your vehicles during the presentation, and that you remember to return your speakers to their posts when the film concludes. Enjoy the show."

The carbon arc lamp brightened. The film began.

Opening credits rolled—stunning photography of Venice, all canals and shadows and decay. The dissonant score drifted from speakers that couldn't possibly work.

Dalton emerged from the booth and joined them, taking a seat in the empty folding chair between the students and the empty lot where he believed his ghost congregation sat.

"Magnificent, isn't it?" he whispered, as if they were in a sacred space where silence was required. "Roeg shot this on location. Every canal, every church, every crumbling palazzo—all real. No soundstages. You can feel the authenticity."

On screen, Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie played a couple grieving their drowned daughter, trying to find meaning in Venice while eerie portents accumulated around them.

Dalton watched with rapt attention, occasionally glancing to his right as if checking on other audience members. Sometimes he smiled and nodded, acknowledging some unheard comment.

Twenty minutes into the film, during a scene in a Venice restaurant, Dalton chuckled and turned to empty air on his left. "Yes, Mrs. Morrison, the cinematography is extraordinary. Venice becomes a character itself, not just a setting. Roeg understands that place shapes psychology."

He was having a conversation with no one.

Samantha shot Nathan a look. This was their moment—engage him, build rapport through shared love of cinema.

"The editing is remarkable too," she said carefully. "The way Roeg fractures time, intercutting scenes that haven't happened yet. It creates this sense of inevitable tragedy."

Dalton turned to her, his face lighting up. "Exactly! You understand. Most people don't appreciate the formal innovation here. They see it as horror film, but it's really about how we process grief and loss. The supernatural elements are ambiguous—are they real or manifestations of trauma?"

"The same question we ask ourselves," Nathan said, choosing his words carefully, "about the past. What's real memory and what's constructed narrative."

"Yes, yes." Dalton gestured enthusiastically. "This is why I wanted you to see this film tonight. You're documentarians, yes? You understand the relationship between observer and observed, between what happened and how we remember what happened."

"You've thought about this a lot," Samantha said.

"Eleven years," Dalton said quietly. "Eleven years of screenings. Eleven years of thinking about memory and truth and what we owe to the dead."

The film played on. Nathan watched Dalton as much as the screen. The man was utterly absorbed in the movie, his expression shifting with each scene—delight at a beautiful shot, tension during the thriller sequences, sadness during the emotional moments. A true cinephile, experiencing art with complete openness.

And yet he kept turning to empty spaces, sharing the experience with people who weren't there. Offering invisible popcorn. Shushing invisible talkers. Responding to invisible comments about the film.

"Mr. Rollins says the restoration on this print is excellent," Dalton reported at one point, as if Rollins were sitting in that distant speaker post, as if Dalton could hear him across a hundred yards of empty desert.

The moon rose, a thin crescent that did nothing to dispel the darkness. They sat in a pool of light from the screen, watching a film about grief and ghosts and the past refusing to stay buried. Around them, the desert stretched away into nothing. Above them, stars wheeled in their ancient patterns.

And in the projection booth, maintained by eleven years of obsessive care, a 1965 projector cast images across a dying screen for an audience that might or might not exist, depending on whether you believed in ghosts or in the human capacity for infinite delusion.

Nathan filmed it all, capturing a moment that was beautiful and terrible and utterly surreal.

The screening had begun.

And somewhere in the darkness, nine dead people either watched with approval or failed to watch at all.

The ambiguity, Nathan realized, was the whole point.
