# Chapter 26: Aftermath

Three days after the fire, Nathan sat in a conference room at the Pima County Sheriff's Office, watching his footage for the first time since the escape.

Detective Ruiz had returned the camera that morning—evidence reviewed, copied for the official file, now returned to its owner. Standard procedure in cases where the victim's documentation was also evidence of the crime.

The screen showed the Stardust as they'd first seen it: magnificent in decay, the massive screen dominating the desert, speaker posts like sentinels. Nathan's voice in voiceover, explaining the documentary concept. Preserving dying Americana, capturing what's being lost to time and commerce.

How naive that seemed now.

Kevin sat beside him, also watching. The sheriff's department had gathered all five students for a final review of statements, a coordination of testimony before the official report was filed. Dalton Reed's death had been ruled a suicide by fire—though whether you called it suicide or consequences of arson was largely semantic.

The footage continued. Setting up camp. The first inexplicable events—batteries dying, the film playing on its own, sounds that shouldn't exist. Nathan watched himself react with wonder instead of fear. Documenting instead of running.

"You were so excited," Kevin said quietly. "About all of it. Even when things got weird."

"Documentary brain. Everything's just footage."

"Almost got you killed."

Nathan couldn't argue. His obsession with capturing the story had overridden survival instinct. If Kevin hadn't been there with his military pragmatism, if Samantha hadn't researched Dalton's psychology, if Greg's grandfather hadn't warned them about the place... so many small things that kept them alive.

The footage showed their first encounter with Dalton—distant, watching through binoculars. Then Lisa's confrontation in the booth. The journals. The shrine to the nine victims.

Detective Ruiz entered, carrying coffee and a folder. "Preliminary autopsy on Reed came back. Smoke inhalation before burning—he was probably unconscious when the roof collapsed. Some mercy in that, at least."

Nathan wasn't sure mercy was the right word. Dalton had run into that booth deliberately, choosing cinema over life even at the end. Mercy would have been intervention before it got that far. Medication, therapy, connection to other humans instead of eleven years of isolation with ghosts.

But hindsight was useless now.

"We've confirmed his identity through dental records and the journals," Ruiz continued. "Dalton Michael Reed, age 54, projectionist at the Stardust from 1965 to 1972. Disappeared after the fire that killed nine patrons. No family, no next of kin, no one filed a missing persons report. He literally vanished and no one noticed."

That was perhaps the saddest detail. A man disappeared from society and no one cared enough to look. No wonder he'd created a ghost congregation—the dead were the only ones who'd stay.

On screen, the footage showed the phantom screening of *Targets*. Dalton working the projector for an invisible audience, talking to empty air with complete sincerity. Nathan's camera captured it all—the delusion in real time, performed without self-awareness.

"The journals are remarkable," Ruiz said. "Eleven years of daily entries. Film screenings, conversations with the victims, maintenance logs for the projector. He truly believed they were there. Complete psychotic break from reality."

"Or they were there," Lisa said quietly. She'd joined them in the conference room, along with Samantha and Greg. "We don't know for sure."

Ruiz gave her a kind but skeptical look. "Ms. Huang, I understand this was traumatic. But there's no evidence of supernatural activity. Just mental illness and isolation."

"What about the audio?" Greg asked. "My recorder picked up nine distinct voices. We heard them in the storage room."

"Acoustic phenomenon. The drive-in's architecture created echo patterns that mimicked conversation. Combined with your fear and exhaustion, your brains interpreted those patterns as voices."

It was the rational explanation. Kevin nodded along with it. But Nathan saw Lisa's expression—she didn't believe it. Neither did Greg. And Samantha looked thoughtful, weighing evidence against experience.

The footage played on. The screening of *Don't Look Now*, Dalton conversing with ghosts, offering invisible popcorn, describing responses only he could hear. Then the reveal—Dalton explaining his plan to recreate the 1972 fire, the gun appearing, the threat made explicit.

Nathan watched himself react. Terror, yes, but also a kind of determination. He'd kept filming even with a gun pointed at him. Even knowing death was possible, he'd documented.

What did that say about him? That he valued footage over life? Or that recording truth was the only way he knew to process horror?

The screen showed their imprisonment in the storage room, the escape through the wall, the final confrontation. Dalton lighting the gasoline, the fire spreading, Kevin tackling him. Nathan running into the burning booth—this footage was shaky, smoke-obscured, barely comprehensible. But you could see him grab the projector components, see him stumble out with the equipment's heart.

Then Dalton's final run. The camera captured it in terrible clarity—a skeletal man racing toward an inferno, arms spread, disappearing into flames that consumed him instantly. The booth's collapse. The end.

And for just three frames, barely visible through smoke, nine silhouettes arranged in rows. The Morrison family. The Delgados. Rollins in the back.

Nathan had watched this section frame by frame last night, examining those shapes. Were they real? Smoke and heat distortion? His camera's sensor glitching from temperature damage?

He'd never know for certain.

The footage ended. Static, then black.

"That's everything," Nathan said. "Everything that happened at the Stardust."

Ruiz closed his folder. "This will be entered as evidence in the final report. Reed's death ruled self-inflicted during commission of attempted murder and arson. The nine 1972 deaths officially attributed to him—the case is closed after eleven years. Your testimony is consistent, the physical evidence supports it, there are no outstanding questions."

"What about the film collection?" Samantha asked. "You said some of the reels survived."

"Salvaged thirty-seven canisters from the ruins. Half are damaged beyond recovery, but Film Archive specialists think they can restore the rest. Several are rare prints—one's the only surviving 35mm copy of a 1968 indie film thought completely lost. Reed had valuable materials. They'll be donated to the Archive in his name."

So Dalton's preservation efforts hadn't been entirely pointless. Some of what he'd maintained for eleven years would survive, would continue being watched. A legacy beyond madness and murder.

"Can we go?" Greg asked. "I just want this to be over."

Ruiz nodded. "You're free to go. The official report will be filed next week. You might be contacted by journalists—there's significant media interest in this story. How you respond is up to you."

They filed out of the conference room into late October sunshine. Tucson was cooling down from summer's brutal heat, pleasant weather arriving. Life continued its normal rhythms.

But the five students existed in a different rhythm now. The Stardust had reset their internal clocks.

"Media's already calling," Samantha said as they walked to the parking lot. "Arizona Daily Star wants interviews. Channel 4 News. Some guy from the paranormal podcast circuit."

"Are you going to talk to them?" Lisa asked.

"Probably. You know me—can't resist analyzing things publicly." Samantha's humor was returning, the shock wearing off. "Besides, someone should tell the story right. If we don't, they'll make up whatever sells."

Nathan understood. Control the narrative or have it controlled for you. Documentary filmmaker logic.

"I'm not talking to anyone," Greg said firmly. "This is private. What happened, what we experienced—that's ours. I'm not sharing it for entertainment."

Kevin agreed. "Let the official report speak. I don't need to relive it for strangers."

Lisa was quiet, thoughtful. Finally she said, "I might talk to the paranormal people. They'll at least take seriously what we felt. What we heard."

"What you thought you heard," Kevin corrected gently.

"What we heard," Lisa insisted. "You can rationalize it however you want. I know what I experienced."

They reached the parking lot, their vehicles waiting. Three days ago they'd been a group united by proximity and Nathan's documentary project. Now they were bonded by survival—but also fractured by interpretation.

Kevin saw rational explanation for everything. Lisa believed in something beyond the rational. Samantha weighed both perspectives. Greg just wanted to forget. And Nathan... Nathan had footage that could support either reading.

"We should stay in touch," Samantha said, repeating her earlier suggestion. "Check in, make sure we're all processing this okay."

They exchanged phone numbers, promised to call, made vague plans to meet up in a few weeks. But Nathan suspected those plans would evaporate. Trauma bonded people in the moment, but after? Most wanted distance from reminders.

He walked to his car—his father had driven it down from campus—and sat in the driver's seat staring at the steering wheel. His hands were still bandaged, burns healing but tender. Driving would hurt.

Everything would hurt for a while.

A tap on the window. Samantha, leaning down.

"You're going to finish the documentary, aren't you?" she asked through the glass.

Nathan rolled down the window. "I don't know. Maybe."

"Do it. Show people what obsession looks like. What isolation does. Make Dalton Reed a cautionary tale instead of a mystery."

"And if the footage shows ghosts?"

"Then you show ghosts and let people decide what they're seeing. That's documentary ethics—show the truth, even when the truth is ambiguous."

She walked away, leaving Nathan with his camera bag and his burns and his decision.

The footage existed. The story existed. Whether he finished the documentary was just a matter of courage—courage to revisit trauma, to sit with that material for hours of editing, to relive the worst two days of his life in service of storytelling.

Nathan started the car, wincing as his burned hands gripped the wheel.

He'd decide later. Right now, he just wanted to go home.

Behind him, the sheriff's office flagpole flew the Arizona state flag and the American flag, both at half-mast for an unrelated tragedy.

But to Nathan, they felt like they were lowered for the Stardust. For nine people who died in 1972. For one man who died trying to preserve their memory.

For a drive-in theater that became a tomb.

The flags snapped in the desert wind, and Nathan drove toward campus, toward his dorm room, toward a future shaped by two days in the ruins.

The Stardust was gone.

But its story was just beginning.
