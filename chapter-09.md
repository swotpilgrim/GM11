# Chapter 9: Reviewing the Footage

Kevin needed control. Structure. After the chaos of the past twelve hours—equipment failures, impossible film screenings, encountering a man who should be dead—he needed something concrete to analyze.

"We review everything systematically," he announced. "All footage, all audio recordings, every piece of evidence we have. Log it, timestamp it, analyze patterns. Treat this like a tactical assessment."

Nathan nodded, already setting up the Steenbeck viewer again. "Frame-by-frame analysis. Document every appearance."

"Not just appearances," Kevin said. "Movement patterns. Sightlines. How he's tracking us. Where he goes when we don't see him."

They'd found fourteen instances of the figure in their footage so far. Kevin suspected there were more.

He created a log sheet: timestamp, location, distance from camera, visible details, duration. Military precision applied to hunting a ghost. Except this ghost was flesh and blood, barefoot and watching.

They started from the beginning. The first footage shot after arriving—Nathan's establishing shots of the screen at sunset. Kevin advanced frame by frame, watching for anomalies.

"There," Lisa said softly. She'd positioned herself where she could see the viewer. "By the speaker post. Far right of frame."

Kevin froze the image. She was right. At the edge of the frame, barely visible in the failing light, a dark shape stood beside a speaker post. Human-sized. Motionless.

"Timestamp 18:47," Kevin logged. "Distance approximately eighty yards. Duration..." He advanced frame by frame. The figure appeared for twelve frames—half a second at normal speed. "Position: speaker post row nine, position four."

They continued. The tracking shot down the lot—figure visible in background for eight frames. The playground footage—figure partially obscured by jungle gym, fourteen frames. Each time, Kevin logged the details, mapping positions.

By the time they'd reviewed all the footage, Kevin had twenty-two separate sightings logged. Eight more than their initial count.

He spread a hand-drawn map of the drive-in across the floor and marked each position with a timestamp. The pattern that emerged made his tactical instincts scream warning.

"He's circling," Kevin said. "Look. First appearance at 18:47 by the screen. Next at 19:12 by the snack bar. Then 19:34 by the playground. He's tracking counter-clockwise around us, using structures for cover."

Nathan leaned over the map. "Movement speed. Distance from screen to snack bar is... what, a hundred yards?"

"About ninety."

"In twenty-five minutes. That's not fast."

"No. It's patient." Kevin traced the pattern. "He's not trying to close distance. He's observing. Stalking behavior—maintain range, track movements, stay concealed."

"But we were all over the lot," Samantha said. "We were spread out filming. How did he know where we'd be?"

Kevin pointed to the sightlines. "High ground. The booth platform gives him elevated position. He can see the entire lot from there. Watch us move, predict our patterns, position himself accordingly."

"And when we approached the booth?" Lisa asked.

Kevin checked his log. No appearances during their approach to the booth or their initial entry. "He withdrew. We threatened his territory, he pulled back. Defensive behavior."

"Until he played the film," Nathan said.

"Different behavior pattern. That was... what? Communication? Performance?" Kevin shook his head. "I can't categorize it tactically. It doesn't fit normal threat profiles."

"Because he's not a normal threat," Samantha said. "He's been alone for eleven years. Standard threat assessment doesn't apply."

Kevin knew she was right, but it frustrated him. Give him an enemy combatant, a burglary suspect, even a wild animal—he could predict behavior, plan response. But Dalton Reed was operating on logic Kevin couldn't parse.

He moved to physical analysis. They had one relatively clear shot—the figure in profile by the speaker posts. Kevin projected it onto the wall using Nathan's portable viewer.

"Six-foot-two, maybe six-three," he estimated, using the speaker post height as reference. "Weight estimate difficult, but he's emaciated. I'd guess 140 pounds maximum. Long hair, shoulder-length minimum. Full beard, matted. Clothing is dark—appears to be remnants of a uniform. Maroon vest visible here." He pointed. "Matches projectionist uniform from the '70s."

"Barefoot," Lisa observed.

"Correct. No shoes visible in any footage. Callused feet—you can see the thickness of the sole in this frame. He's been barefoot long enough to develop natural protection."

"How do you track barefoot in the desert?" Greg asked. "Rocks, thorns, scorpions—"

"Carefully. And with practice. Native Americans did it for thousands of years. If you're born to it or adapt slowly, feet toughen. Still dangerous, still painful, but possible."

Kevin advanced through the clearest footage. "Posture: upright, alert. No visible weapons. Hands empty in every frame we have. Movement: deliberate, controlled. He's not stumbling or weak despite apparent malnutrition. That suggests physical competence."

"Is he a threat?" Nathan asked directly.

"Physically? Maybe. He's thin but mobile. Knows the terrain. Has the advantage of familiarity and preparation. We're in his environment." Kevin paused. "Mentally? That's the real question. He's demonstrated capacity for violence—nine deaths. But that was eleven years ago. Current mental state is unknown."

"The logbook suggests ongoing delusion," Samantha said.

"Delusion doesn't always mean violent. Could be passive. Could be dangerous if threatened." Kevin looked at the group. "I can't give you a definitive threat assessment. Too many variables."

"What about the audio?" Greg asked. He had his reel-to-reel set up, recordings from the previous night queued. "I went through everything. Found some weird shit."

He played the first segment. Their voices filming the playground, then underneath—whispers. Greg had isolated them, amplified them. Male voice, low and rough:

"My theater. My audience."

"That's from when we were at the playground," Greg said. "Around 22:30. But none of us heard anyone speak. It's on the recording but not... audible at the time."

"Distance," Kevin said. "He was far enough that ambient noise and our conversation masked it. But the microphone picked it up."

Greg played another segment. "This was during the booth approach. 23:15."

A whisper, clearer: "Stay for the show."

"And this was right before the film started playing."

The whisper was almost excited: "They'll love this. The audience is here."

Lisa had gone pale. "He's talking about us. We're his audience."

"He's been talking to himself for eleven years," Samantha said. "Talking to ghosts. Now he has real people. Of course he's...performing for us."

Kevin played back the recordings, analyzing vocal patterns. Consistent speaker across all recordings. Male, adult, speech patterns educated despite the rough quality. No slurring, no incoherence. Whoever was speaking was lucid enough to form complete thoughts.

"Voice spectrograph would tell us more," he said. "But we don't have equipment for that. Based on what we can hear—same speaker, consistent pattern, targeting us specifically in his speech."

"So he knows we're here," Nathan said. "Knows we're filming. Is consciously choosing to appear in our footage sometimes and avoid us other times."

"Correct. Which means he has agency, planning capability. He's not just a madman wandering the ruins. He's in control of his actions."

The implications settled over the group. A man who'd killed nine people, who'd survived alone for over a decade, who was now watching them and talking about them as his "audience." And that man was in complete control of his faculties.

"Okay," Nathan said slowly. "So we have a comprehensive profile. Dalton Reed, confirmed alive, living in the projection booth, physically capable, mentally lucid enough to plan and execute complex tasks like maintaining projection equipment and staging screenings. He's been tracking us since we arrived, speaking about us, positioning himself to watch."

"And what does he want?" Lisa asked. The question everyone was thinking.

Kevin looked at the map of sightings, the audio transcriptions, the footage frozen on the emaciated figure watching from the shadows.

"He wants us to watch," he said finally. "Everything points to that. The film screening, the careful positioning so cameras catch him, the audio comments about audiences. He's been projecting films for ghosts for eleven years. Now he has real people."

"So we watch," Nathan said. "We document. We give him what he wants while gathering evidence."

"That assumes giving him what he wants keeps us safe," Kevin countered. "It might. Or it might encourage escalation. We don't know his endgame."

"The nine victims in 1972," Samantha said quietly. "They were an audience too. They came to watch films. He burned them alive."

The room went silent.

"Different context," Nathan said, but he didn't sound convinced. "That was rage at Rollins. Workplace violence. This is..."

"This is a man who thinks dead people are still watching movies," Greg said bluntly. "And we're camping in his personal theater. How long before he decides to make us permanent audience members?"

Kevin had no answer. The tactical assessment was clear: they were in a controlled environment with a potential hostile who had superior knowledge of terrain, demonstrated capacity for violence, and unclear intentions. Standard protocol would be immediate evacuation and overwhelming force response.

But they'd voted to stay. And Nathan's eyes still had that gleam—the documentarian who'd found the story of a lifetime.

"We continue systematic observation," Kevin decided. "Maintain defensive posture, document everything, watch for behavior changes. And we keep the van accessible. Any sign of escalation, we abort immediately."

"Define escalation," Lisa said.

"Direct approach. Threatening behavior. Attempts to block exits or disable the van. Anything that suggests transition from observation to action."

"And if he just... watches?" Nathan asked.

"Then we watch back," Kevin said. "And we pray that's enough."

Outside, the morning sun beat down on the Stardust Drive-In. The projection booth sat silent on its platform, windows dark and empty.

But Kevin knew better now. Empty didn't mean unoccupied.

Somewhere in those shadows, Dalton Reed was watching.

Waiting for the next show to begin.
