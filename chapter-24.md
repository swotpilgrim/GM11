# Chapter 24: The Fire

The fire trucks arrived at 7:32 AM, three engines from Pima County Fire Department racing down the access road with sirens wailing. By then, the Stardust was already lost. What had been an abandoned drive-in was now a smoldering crater, black smoke rising in a column visible from Highway 10.

Nathan sat in the back of the sheriff's cruiser, watching firefighters spray water on ruins. Lisa beside him, both of them wrapped in emergency blankets despite the rising desert heat. Shock, the paramedic had said. Smoke inhalation. Minor burns. They'd been lucky.

Kevin stood near the command vehicle, giving his statement to a deputy. Samantha and Greg were being treated by paramedics—dehydration from their ten-mile run through the desert, but otherwise unharmed. They'd flagged down a trucker at the Highway 10 truck stop at 6:47 AM, exactly two hours and twelve minutes after leaving the Stardust. The trucker had called 911. The sheriff had found them and raced back.

Too late to stop the fire. But in time to save lives.

"Did you see him?" Lisa asked quietly. "When the booth collapsed. Did you see Dalton?"

Nathan had. That terrible silhouette in the flames, arms spread, choosing cinema over survival. Choosing delusion over escape.

"Yeah. I saw."

"Do you think he felt it? The burning?"

"I don't know. Maybe the smoke got him first." Nathan hoped that was true, though he doubted it. Dalton had run into that inferno fully conscious, fully aware. He'd felt everything.

The fire captain approached, a weathered woman in her fifties with soot on her face. "You're the ones who were trapped inside?"

"Yes, ma'am," Nathan said.

"Lucky you got out. Structure was fully involved when we arrived—roof collapsed, walls down, fire load from decades of accumulated materials." She gestured to where the booth had stood. "No one could survive that. We'll recover remains once it cools, but..." She trailed off. No need to finish. They all knew what fire did to human bodies.

"There's a body in there," Nathan confirmed. "Dalton Reed. The man who's been living here since 1972."

The captain's eyebrows rose. "Since '72? That's—Jesus. Eleven years?"

"He was the projectionist. Started the fire that killed nine people. Never left."

Understanding crossed her face. She'd heard about the 1972 fire. Everyone in Tucson over a certain age remembered the Stardust tragedy. Nine deaths, arson, a suspect who vanished.

"We'll let the sheriff's department handle that," she said. "You kids just focus on getting checked out, giving statements. This is gonna be a long day."

She wasn't wrong.

The next six hours were a blur of authority figures. Detectives from Pima County Sheriff's Office taking detailed statements. Paramedics treating minor injuries—Nathan's burned hands from the projector components, Greg's blistered feet from the desert run, everyone's smoke-damaged lungs. News helicopters circling overhead once word spread: the Stardust Drive-In, site of the 1972 massacre, had burned again with the original arsonist's body inside.

By noon, a crowd had gathered on the highway—news crews, curiosity seekers, locals who remembered the drive-in from before the fire. The sheriff's department set up a perimeter, keeping them back. This was an active investigation now: arson, murder, kidnapping, and death.

Nathan watched investigators photograph the scene, document evidence, prepare to recover Dalton's remains once the rubble cooled enough. His camera sat in an evidence bag, footage unviewed but logged. The projector components he'd salvaged were also bagged and tagged. Everything was evidence now.

"You did a crazy thing," Samantha said, sitting down beside him on the ambulance bumper. Her voice was hoarse from running and dust. "Going into that burning building."

"Documentary instinct. Get the shot."

"You almost died for a shot."

"Wouldn't be the first time someone did." Nathan looked at his bandaged hands. Second-degree burns across the palms and fingers. He'd grabbed those lenses knowing they were hot enough to scar. "But yeah. Crazy."

"He's really dead, isn't he? Dalton."

"Yeah."

"Good." Samantha's voice was flat. "He was going to burn us alive for his art project. Fuck him."

Nathan understood the anger. He felt it too, mixed with something more complicated. Dalton Reed had been a murderer, a kidnapper, completely delusional. But he'd also been a man who loved cinema so much it destroyed him, who'd maintained a projection booth in the desert for eleven years because he couldn't let it go. There was something tragic in that, even amid the horror.

"Did you see them?" Lisa asked, joining them. "At the end. The nine people."

Samantha shot Nathan a look: don't encourage her.

But Nathan remembered those silhouettes against the flames. Nine shapes that might have been smoke and heat distortion. Or might have been something else.

"I saw something," he said carefully. "Could have been anything."

"I saw them too," Lisa said. "When we were running. I looked back and I saw people in the lot. Watching the screen burn. Like they were waiting for it."

"Heat hallucination," Kevin said, approaching with bottles of water. "Trauma, exhaustion, your brain filling in patterns because that's what brains do."

"Maybe." Lisa didn't sound convinced.

Greg had been silent since they'd been found by the sheriff. Now he spoke, voice shaky: "My audio recorder. The one that picked up the nine voices during the screening. Did the deputies take it?"

"Evidence," Kevin confirmed. "They took all our equipment."

"So they'll hear it. The nine voices. They'll have proof."

"Proof of audio artifacts," Kevin said. "Not ghosts."

"You don't know that."

"I know there's no such thing as ghosts. I know Dalton Reed was schizophrenic or delusional or suffering from eleven years of isolation-induced psychosis. I know that what we experienced was a man's mental illness manifesting as a hostage situation. That's all."

But even Kevin looked shaken. Whatever certainty he'd had about the rational world had been tested by two days at the Stardust.

A detective approached—middle-aged Hispanic man with kind eyes, notepad in hand. Detective Ruiz, he'd introduced himself earlier. He'd been very patient with their statements, very careful to get details right.

"Preliminary findings," he said. "We found gasoline canisters, match books, evidence of premeditation. Journals going back to 1972 documenting the suspect's activities and delusions. And we found something else in the ruins."

He held up an evidence bag containing film canisters. Scorched, damaged, but recognizable.

"Dalton Reed had a collection of rare films. Some of them might be salvageable. Archive-quality prints that were thought lost. Doesn't excuse what he did, but it's... interesting. Man spent eleven years preserving cinema while planning to destroy it."

Nathan thought about that. The contradiction at Dalton's core—love and destruction, preservation and immolation. He'd maintained films for eleven years, then burned them all in one morning. Art and madness, impossible to separate.

"When can we leave?" Samantha asked.

"Soon. We need your contact information, you might be called for further questioning or court proceedings if there are civil suits. But you're free to go today. We've contacted your families, they're driving down from Tucson."

Nathan's parents. He'd been dreading that conversation. How do you tell your parents you were kidnapped by a madman and nearly burned alive because you wanted to film abandoned buildings?

The answer: you didn't. You let the police tell them, then dealt with the aftermath.

By 3 PM, the fire was fully extinguished. Investigators moved into the ruins with cameras and evidence bags. The Stardust was now officially a crime scene for the second time in its history.

Nathan watched them work, documenting what remained. The massive screen was gone, collapsed into twisted metal and ash. The projection booth was rubble. Speaker posts had melted into abstract sculptures. The snack bar was a charred foundation. Fifty-eight years of history erased in three hours.

And in the center of it all, where the booth had stood, investigators placed a marker. Human remains. Dalton Reed's final position, arms spread toward where the screen had been.

"Do you think he's still here?" Lisa asked. "His ghost. Watching."

"No," Nathan said. But he wasn't sure he believed it.

The projector components he'd salvaged were the last physical pieces of Dalton's eleven-year vigil. Everything else was ash and memory. If ghosts existed, if the Stardust really was haunted, then Dalton Reed had joined his congregation. Nine became ten. The faithful watching eternal screenings that no camera could capture.

But that was speculation. Fantasy. The kind of narrative humans created to make sense of senseless things.

What Nathan knew for certain: five students had survived. One man had died. And the footage in his camera would tell a story that people would debate for years—documentary evidence of obsession, delusion, and the terrible cost of loving art too much.

As the sun began its descent toward evening, their families arrived. Nathan's parents pulled him into a crushing hug, his mother crying, his father silent and shell-shocked. Around the lot, similar scenes played out. Samantha's mom, Kevin's father, Lisa's parents, Greg's entire extended family.

They were going home. Leaving the Stardust to investigators and eventually to developers who'd bulldoze what remained and build something new. The site would become a strip mall or housing development, the same fate Dalton had feared.

But the story would survive. The footage would survive.

And somewhere in the desert night, nine speaker posts still stood like tombstones.

Whether anyone watched from them, Nathan would leave for others to decide.

The Stardust was gone.

But its ghosts—real or imagined—would linger forever.
