# Chapter 22: Escape Attempt

The hole in the wall was eighteen inches wide, low against the floor where the concrete blocks had finally given way. Tight, but passable. Beyond it, the abandoned kitchen waited in darkness.

Nathan crouched beside it, watching Lisa prepare to crawl through. She was the smallest, would go first to test if the passage was clear.

"Kitchen's boarded," Greg whispered, examining the gap with his flashlight. "But boards we can break. Window faces away from the booth—he won't see us leave."

4:47 AM. The projection booth was dark, no movement visible. Dalton was either asleep or waiting, watching in silence. Either way, they were out of time. Dawn would come in ninety minutes, and with it Dalton's check on his prisoners.

"Go," Kevin said to Lisa. "Quiet. No noise until you're through the window."

She nodded, got down on her belly, and started crawling. The gap was tight—concrete scraping her shoulders, the passage barely wide enough. Nathan held his breath. If she got stuck, if she made noise...

But Lisa was through, disappearing into the kitchen's darkness. A moment later, her whispered voice came back: "Clear. Boards are loose."

Samantha went next, moving faster, more confident. Then Greg, who barely fit, his breath coming hard as he squeezed through the narrow opening.

Nathan and Kevin remained in the storage room.

"You sure about this?" Kevin asked quietly. "Staying behind?"

"Someone has to make sure he doesn't burn it all anyway. Destroy the projector, we destroy his anchor." Nathan checked his camera. "And if it goes bad, there's footage. Evidence."

Kevin picked up the wrench. "When he opens that door in the morning, we take him. Hard and fast."

From the kitchen came the sound of boards breaking—quiet, controlled, but audible. They both froze, watching the projection booth. No lights. No movement. Dalton either didn't hear or was letting them go. Neither option was comforting.

A minute later, Samantha's face appeared at the hole. "We're out. Window's clear. Kevin, Nathan—last chance to come with us."

"Go," Nathan said. "Ten miles to the truck stop. Flag down the first vehicle. Bring police."

"If you're not here when we get back—"

"We will be."

She hesitated, then disappeared. Footsteps, faint, moving away from the snack bar toward the fence gap. Three people escaping into the desert, racing the sun toward the highway.

Nathan and Kevin sat in the storage room's dim light, listening to silence reclaim the night.

"Now what?" Nathan asked.

"Now we wait for him to check on us." Kevin positioned himself beside the door, wrench ready. "He opens it, I take the gun hand. You grab the weapon. We restrain him, wait for police."

"Simple."

"Simple gets you killed in complicated situations. But it's all we've got."

They waited. An hour passed. The desert began its transformation from black to gray, the first hint of dawn touching the eastern horizon. Birds started calling—desert doves, their mournful coos carrying across the empty lot.

5:47 AM. The projection booth door opened.

Dalton emerged, stretching, moving with the casual ease of someone who'd slept well. He carried the revolver but didn't seem alert, didn't seem to suspect escape. He walked toward the snack bar humming theater organ music.

"Ready," Kevin whispered.

Footsteps approached. Stopped outside the door. The deadbolt scraped.

"Good morning!" Dalton's voice was cheerful. "I hope you slept—"

He opened the door.

Kevin lunged, swinging the wrench at Dalton's gun hand. But Dalton was faster than he looked—eleven years of desert survival had made him quick. He jerked back, the wrench missing by inches.

The revolver came up.

"Don't," Dalton said quietly. The playful host was gone. This was something colder.

Kevin froze, wrench raised.

"Set it down." Dalton's finger was on the trigger. "Slowly."

Kevin lowered the wrench to the floor.

Dalton's gaze swept the room, taking in the hole in the wall, the missing people. Understanding bloomed across his face—not anger, but something sadder.

"They left," he said. "Ran into the desert."

"They're getting help," Nathan said. "Police will be here in hours. It's over, Dalton."

"Over?" Dalton laughed, a broken sound. "It's been over for eleven years. This was always how it ended."

He gestured with the gun. "Out. Both of you. Toward the booth."

They walked into the pre-dawn grayness, Dalton behind them with the revolver. The lot was transforming in the growing light—speaker posts emerging from shadow, the massive screen a pale rectangle against the lightning sky.

"Where do you think they'll get?" Dalton asked conversationally. "Ten miles through desert? No water, no food, heat coming on fast? Maybe they make it. Maybe the desert takes them. Either way, they won't be back in time."

"In time for what?" Kevin asked.

"For the final screening, of course." Dalton directed them past the booth toward the screen. "7 PM tonight. Whether police come or not. Whether your friends survive or not. The Stardust ends today."

He'd already prepared. Nathan saw it as they approached the screen's base—five red gasoline canisters arranged around the lot, modern plastic containers that stood out against the vintage decay. Fuel for the fire. Fuel for Dalton's final statement.

"I was going to wait until tonight," Dalton said. "Give us all day to prepare, to choose films, to make peace. But your friends changed the timeline." He checked the sky, gauging the light. "We have maybe three hours before police arrive. So we do it now."

"Do what?" Nathan asked, though he knew.

"Create the masterpiece." Dalton's voice carried religious fervor. "Film the Stardust's apotheosis. The perfect marriage of cinema and fire."

Kevin tensed, preparing to rush him. But Dalton saw it.

"Don't. I'll shoot you in the leg, let you burn conscious. That's not how I want this to go." The gun steadied. "This is meant to be beautiful. Transcendent. Don't make it ugly."

"It's already ugly," Nathan said. "This is murder-suicide dressed up in film theory. You're not creating art. You're just killing people."

"You don't understand yet." Dalton gestured to the lot, to the screen, to the projection booth glowing in dawn's first light. "In three hours, police come. They see a madman, a crime scene, evidence of delusion. They write it off as tragedy, tear down what's left, build a strip mall. The Stardust vanishes."

He walked to one of the gasoline canisters, unscrewed the cap. The smell of fuel cut through the desert air.

"But if I burn it now, if you film it, if the footage survives—then it becomes something else. A statement. A refusal. One man's stand against the death of cinema." He poured gasoline in a line across the lot. "The faithful nine understand. They've been waiting for this."

"They're not here," Kevin said. "They've never been here. You're alone, Dalton."

"I'm never alone." Dalton poured more fuel, creating a pattern across the lot—lines radiating from the booth like a star. "They're with me always. And soon you'll be with them."

Nathan had his camera. He raised it, started filming. Not because he agreed, not because this was art, but because documentation was all he had left. If he was going to die, someone would know why.

Dalton saw the camera, smiled. "Good. Yes. Film it all. Get the screen, the booth, the gasoline patterns. Capture the beauty."

He moved to the projection booth, still directing them at gunpoint. Inside, he powered up the equipment. The projector hummed to life, carbon arc lamp glowing. A film was already threaded—Nathan couldn't see which one, but Dalton caressed the reels with tenderness.

"This is the film I showed them in '72," Dalton said. "A horror double-feature. Seems appropriate for the ending."

The projector beam lanced out, hitting the screen. Title card: THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. Howard Hawks, 1951.

"A classic," Dalton said. "About something that won't die, that keeps coming back. Fitting, yes?"

He poured gasoline around the booth's base, working systematically. The fuel soaked into old wood, pooled on concrete. The smell was overwhelming now, chemical and final.

"In the film," Dalton continued, "they burn the monster. Fire as purification. Fire as solution." He set down the empty canister. "The faithful nine will watch one last time. You'll film. And when the fire starts, we'll all transcend together."

Kevin shifted, looking for an opening. But Dalton had positioned himself well—booth at his back, gun covering them, gasoline surrounding all approaches.

Nathan kept filming. The screen, the booth, Dalton's face in the projector's reflected light. Documentation. Evidence. Truth.

"When do police arrive?" Dalton asked. "Two hours? Three? Enough time for the film to play, for the fire to take hold." He pulled matches from his vest pocket. Old-fashioned strike-anywhere matches, the kind that could light from friction.

"Don't," Nathan said.

"I have to." Dalton's voice was gentle. "This is what I was meant to do. Why I survived eleven years. The faithful nine kept me alive for this."

He struck a match.

The tiny flame was almost invisible in the growing daylight. But Dalton held it reverently, like a sacrament.

"For cinema," he whispered. "For the Stardust. For the faithful nine who understood what art demands."

He dropped the match.

Gasoline ignited with a whoosh, blue flames racing along the lines he'd poured. The pattern bloomed across the lot like a flower of fire, spreading toward the booth, toward the screen, toward everything Dalton had maintained for eleven years.

The projection booth caught first—old wood and gasoline created instant conflagration. Flames climbed the walls, smoke bil lowing. But the projector kept running inside the inferno, beam still hitting the screen, film still playing.

On screen, scientists battled the Thing. On the ground, Dalton stood watching his creation burn, revolver hanging loose in his hand, face rapturous.

"Beautiful," he breathed. "Perfect."

Kevin saw his chance and took it.

He rushed Dalton while the man was mesmerized by fire. Hit him hard, both going down. The revolver skittered across pavement. Nathan dove for it, fingers closing on warm metal.

"Run!" Kevin yelled, grappling with Dalton. "Get clear!"

But Nathan didn't run. He pointed the gun at Dalton.

"Stop. Both of you stop."

They froze, Kevin pinning Dalton to the ground.

Behind them, the Stardust burned.
