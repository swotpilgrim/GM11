# Chapter 16: Dalton's Phantom Audience

The afternoon stretched long and tense. Nathan watched the projection booth through his camera's viewfinder, back against the snack bar wall. The sun hung low over the western hills, painting the desert amber and rust. Shadows from the speaker posts lengthened across the cracked asphalt.

He'd been watching for three hours. Nothing moved except wind pushing tumbleweeds against the fence.

"This is insane." Greg paced behind him. "We should be halfway to Tucson by now."

"Van's still dead," Kevin said from near the open hood. "And he's got the distributor cap. We're not going anywhere on foot in this heat."

Twenty miles to the highway. Ninety-degree sun. No water except what they had in the cooler. Nathan knew Kevin was right, but it didn't ease the knot in his chest.

Samantha sat cross-legged nearby, Dalton's journals spread around her. She'd been reading for hours, occasionally reading passages aloud. Eleven years of madness documented in obsessive handwriting.

"Listen to this," she said, tapping a page dated October 1981. "Tuesday night, showed 'The Wild Bunch' for Mr. Rollins. He finally understands what I tried to tell him about Peckinpah's use of violence as catharsis. We talked for hours afterward. He apologized again for what he did to me, to this place. I forgive him, of course. The dead understand what the living cannot.'"

"He's completely gone," Greg said. "Talking to people he murdered like they're his friends."

"Not friends." Samantha looked up, her face pale beneath her freckles. "Congregation. He thinks he's running a church."

Lisa sat apart from them, hugging her knees, staring at nothing. She hadn't said much since her encounter in the booth. Nathan wanted to comfort her but didn't know what to say. What comfort existed when you'd been face to face with a killer?

The projection booth came alive at 4:47 PM.

The sound reached them first—a mechanical hum, deep and steady, like a generator kicking on. Then lights bloomed in the booth's narrow windows, yellow and warm against the gathering dusk.

Nathan raised his camera. Through the telephoto lens, he could see movement inside—shadows shifting, equipment being positioned. The unmistakable click and whir of film threading through a projector.

"He's starting a show," Nathan said.

Kevin grabbed the binoculars. "I see him. Moving around in there, working the equipment."

Greg had his audio recorder running, headphones clamped over his ears. His expression shifted from concentration to confusion to something like fear. "Do you guys hear that?"

"Hear what?" Samantha moved closer.

Greg pulled one headphone back. "Voices. Multiple voices. Like... like people arriving for a movie."

Nathan heard nothing except the wind and the projector's mechanical rhythm. "What kind of voices?"

"Conversation. Laughter. Someone just said something about the weather." Greg adjusted the recorder's levels, frowning at the VU meters. "It's picking up crowd sounds. But there's nobody there."

"Let me hear." Kevin took the headphones, listened, his skeptical expression hardening. "Could be interference. Radio bleed from Tucson, trucker CB chatter."

"That's not what interference sounds like." Greg's hands shook slightly as he made notes. "That's ambient conversation. Movie theater crowd waiting for the show to start."

The projector beam lanced out from the booth, cutting through the dusty air. It hit the massive screen in a rectangle of white light that seemed almost solid, like you could reach out and touch it. The light flickered, stabilized, and then images appeared.

A title card, stark black text on white: TARGETS.

"Oh no," Samantha whispered. "Oh Christ, he's showing us Targets."

"What's that?" Nathan kept filming, capturing the surreal sight of a movie playing to an empty drive-in.

"Peter Bogdanovich, 1968. Boris Karloff's last good film." Samantha's voice had gone flat, academic, the way it did when she was frightened and defaulting to facts. "It's about a mass shooter who kills people at a drive-in theater. Sniper picking off families in their cars during the show."

The five of them stood in silence, watching the film play across the enormous screen. The opening credits rolled. Orchestral music drifted from the speaker posts—impossible, since they'd checked every speaker and found them rusted through, wiring rotted away decades ago. Yet somehow the sound came through clear and period-authentic, crackling like vinyl.

Nathan raised the binoculars and focused on the booth window.

Dalton Reed moved through the small space with practiced efficiency, adjusting the projector, checking the focus, monitoring the feed. But he wasn't alone in his movements. He kept turning to empty spaces, nodding, gesturing, speaking to air. His mouth moved constantly in conversation with people who weren't there.

Then Dalton turned toward the booth window and pantomimed selling popcorn. His hands scooped invisible kernels into invisible bags. He took invisible money, made invisible change, handed invisible treats through the booth's service window to invisible customers. All with a broad smile, the gracious host.

"He's selling concessions," Nathan said, unable to keep the horror from his voice. "To nobody."

"Not nobody," Lisa said quietly. "To them. The nine people he killed. He thinks they're here."

Kevin grabbed the binoculars, studied the booth. "Son of a bitch is completely delusional. This isn't just trauma or guilt. His grip on reality is gone."

"It's been gone for eleven years," Samantha said. "This is what happens when you live alone with what you've done. He's created an entire fantasy where they forgave him, where they come back every night, where he's still needed."

The film played on. Nathan had never seen Targets, but the scenes were chilling—a clean-cut young man buying rifles, practicing at a range, planning violence with calm precision. Boris Karloff played an aging horror star, lamenting that the real world had become more horrific than anything he'd put on screen.

The irony wasn't lost on Nathan. Film students watching a movie about movie violence while trapped by a man whose violence sprang from cinematic obsession.

"He's sending us a message," Greg said. "Showing us a film about a mass shooting at a drive-in. That's what he's planning to do to us."

"Maybe." Samantha chewed her thumbnail, a nervous habit Nathan had noticed increasing over the past two days. "Or he thinks it's just... appropriate. Cinema about cinema. He probably sees it as an artistic statement."

"Artistic." Kevin's voice dripped contempt. "Nine people died. We're being threatened by a murderer. This isn't film theory, Sam."

"I know that." Her voice snapped with rare anger. "But understanding his psychology might keep us alive. He's not just a killer. He's a believer. A fanatic. Cinema is his religion, this place is his temple, and those nine people are his congregation."

"And what does that make us?" Greg asked.

Nobody answered.

The film ran ninety minutes. They watched it all, unable to look away. The projector beam never wavered. Sound crackled from dead speakers. In the booth, Dalton performed his duties with the dedication of a priest—changing reels at precise moments, adjusting focus, checking every detail.

Twice, Greg's audio recorder picked up applause—full theater applause, dozens of hands—from the empty lot.

As the sun touched the horizon, painting the desert blood-red, the film reached its climax. The sniper at the drive-in, picking off victims one by one while a horror movie played on the screen. Families dying in their cars, trapped in the dark, murdered for no reason except that they were there.

The film ended. Credits rolled.

The projector shut off, plunging the screen into darkness. For a long moment, nothing moved. The desert held its breath.

Then the speaker system crackled to life with a squeal of feedback that made them all jump. When the voice came through, it was cultured, theatrical, the smooth cadence of a professional announcer:

"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I trust you enjoyed this evening's presentation. Tonight's feature was selected especially for our honored guests—the young filmmakers who've come to document our little piece of history."

Dalton's voice, refined and articulate, nothing like the wild thing Lisa had described from her encounter. This was the voice of a man in control, performing a role he'd perfected over eleven years.

"I have a special request," the voice continued. "Tonight at sundown, we'll be holding a premiere screening. A new work, years in the making. I do hope you'll attend as my personal guests. The audience has been so looking forward to meeting you properly."

Static hissed. Then silence.

Nathan lowered his camera, hands trembling. The light faded fast, shadows merging into dusk. The projection booth windows went dark. Somewhere in that darkness, Dalton Reed was preparing for tonight's show.

"We can't go," Greg said. "Whatever he's planning, we can't just walk into it."

"He's not giving us a choice." Kevin pointed at the van. "We're trapped here. When the sun goes down, he controls this place. Every hiding spot, every shadow. His territory."

"Then we make a choice." Nathan surprised himself with the steadiness in his voice. "We go to his screening, but we go prepared. We document everything, we stay together, and we watch for any chance to escape or turn this around."

"Document." Lisa laughed, a broken sound. "You want to film our own murders."

"I want evidence," Nathan said. "If something happens to us, I want a record. I want people to know what happened here, who did it, why." He met her eyes. "And I want to survive this. But if we're going to do that, we need to understand what we're dealing with."

"We're dealing with a psychotic killer who's been playing movies for ghosts," Greg said. "What else do we need to understand?"

Samantha stood, brushing dust from her jeans. "We need to understand what he wants from us. Why now, after eleven years? We're not random victims. He's been watching us since we arrived. He had chances to hurt us and didn't. He wants something specific."

"He wants an audience," Lisa said softly. "A real one. People who understand cinema the way he does. People who'll witness whatever he's planning."

"Then we'll be his audience," Nathan said. "Until we're not."

The sun dropped below the hills. The desert transformed from amber to purple to black. Stars emerged in the vast sky, indifferent to the small human drama playing out below. Somewhere in the darkness, the projection booth waited.

And in two hours, they would walk into it.

Nathan started checking his camera, making sure he had fresh film, that the batteries were charged, that every technical detail was perfect. It was something to do, a familiar ritual that steadied his hands. But beneath the mechanical routine, fear coiled cold and patient.

The phantom audience Dalton played for—were they really ghosts? Or just the echo of guilt in a shattered mind?

Either way, tonight they would find out.

The show was about to begin.
