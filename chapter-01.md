# Chapter 1: Arrival at the Stardust

The 1978 Ford Econoline van kicked up dust as Nathan turned off the two-lane highway onto the access road. The pavement ended immediately, giving way to cracked asphalt and desert hardpan. Through the bug-spattered windshield, the Stardust Drive-In appeared like a monument to something America had already forgotten.

"Jesus Christ," Greg muttered from the back seat.

The screen dominated everything. Seven stories of peeling white paint and exposed steel frame, it rose from the flat desert like a tombstone facing the wrong direction. Nathan could see bullet holes and graffiti tags even from a quarter mile out. Behind it, saguaros stood sentinel in the October heat.

Nathan felt something catch in his chest. This was exactly what he'd hoped for. Exactly what his thesis needed.

"That's something," Samantha said quietly from the passenger seat. She leaned forward, strawberry blonde ponytail swinging as she craned to see through the windshield. "The photos don't do it justice."

"My grandfather said this place was cursed," Greg said. His boot tapped a nervous rhythm against the van's wheel well. "Said we shouldn't come here."

"Your grandfather also said that fluoride was a communist plot," Kevin observed from the back, where he sat wedged between equipment cases. His crew cut was dark with sweat despite the open windows. "Man didn't trust anything he couldn't fix with a wrench."

"He was right about this place, though." Greg fumbled with his bolo tie—turquoise and silver, his grandfather's gift. "Nine people died here. You don't just forget that."

"We're not forgetting," Nathan said. He guided the van past a sagging chain-link fence with NO TRESPASSING signs zip-tied every ten feet. Someone had cut a gap wide enough to drive through. "We're documenting. There's a difference."

Lisa hadn't said anything since they'd left Tucson. She sat beside Greg, delicate hands folded in her lap, dark eyes fixed on the approaching ruins. Nathan glanced at her in the rearview mirror and saw her braided hair shifting as she turned her head, tracking the screen as they drove closer.

"You okay back there, Lisa?" he asked.

"It's sad," she said softly. "All this space. All this silence. It used to be full of families."

The access road curved past what had once been the entrance kiosk—a small booth with a ticket window, now just a shell with the roof caved in and graffiti covering every surface. Beyond it stretched the lot itself, arranged in gentle curved rows that had once held four hundred cars. The speaker posts still stood, rusted metal poles with the speaker housings dangling like severed heads. Wind moved through them, creating a low whistle that made Nathan's skin prickle.

He parked near what looked like it had been the concession stand, a low concrete building sitting off to the left of the lot. Most of its windows were boarded over, and part of the roof had collapsed into what must have been the main serving area. But the back section looked intact—just badly weathered.

"Home sweet home," Kevin said, already unbuckling. "Let's check structural integrity before we start unloading."

They climbed out into the late afternoon heat. It had to be ninety degrees still, though the sun was descending toward the mountains. The temperature would drop to the fifties once darkness fell. Nathan stretched, feeling his back pop after three hours driving.

The smell hit him immediately. Creosote and dust, rust and abandonment. Broken glass crunched under his sneakers.

Samantha was already filming with her personal camera, a compact Minolta she kept for quick shots. "Nathan, get the Bolex. The light right now is perfect."

She was right. The golden hour painted the screen in amber and rust, the graffiti almost beautiful in the fading light.

Kevin and Nathan checked the concession stand while the others waited. The front section was a loss—collapsed ceiling, broken tile, evidence of old fires. But the back rooms were solid. Concrete walls, intact roof, a floor covered in dust but structurally sound.

"We can work with this," Kevin said. "It'll keep the wind off us."

"It's perfect," Nathan said.

Kevin gave him a look. "It's shelter. Don't romanticize."

They unloaded equipment in stages. The film gear first—two 16mm Bolex cameras borrowed from the university. Then sound equipment: Kevin's reel-to-reel recorder, boom mic, cables. Battery packs, lights, tripods. Everything analog.

Greg set up the camping stove while Lisa swept the room. Samantha spread her research across an old counter—newspaper clippings, photocopies, notes. The Morrison family. The Delgados. Jack Rollins and his wife. Nine people dead when projectionist Dalton Reed set fire to the booth during a Friday night screening in October 1972.

Eleven years ago. Almost to the day.

"You sure you want to do this?" Kevin asked Nathan quietly as they carried in the last equipment case. "It's not too late to set up somewhere else. Film the exterior, do interviews in town, call it good."

Nathan looked out at the lot, at the speaker posts marching in silent rows toward the massive screen. The projection booth sat behind and slightly below the screen, a squat concrete bunker with broken windows and a padlocked door. Something about it drew his eye, made him want to climb up there and see what remained.

"This is the story," he said. "Not just drive-in culture dying. This specific place. What happened here. What it means that we're letting these places rot."

"Nine people died here, Nathan. This isn't some nostalgic time capsule. It's a crime scene."

"I know what it is." Nathan adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses, a nervous habit. "That's why we need to document it. Before they bulldoze it for a strip mall and it's just gone. Like it never mattered."

Kevin studied him for a long moment, then nodded. "Your call. You're the director. But we do this safe, understand? We're not taking stupid risks for footage."

"Agreed."

By the time they finished setting up, the sun was touching the mountains. Shadows stretched long across the lot, and the temperature had already dropped ten degrees. Greg started the generator they'd brought, and Kevin rigged up work lights in their makeshift camp. The rumble of the generator seemed obscenely loud in the desert silence.

"We should check out the rest of the place before it gets full dark," Samantha said. She'd changed into jeans and a denim jacket, her film festival pins catching the light. "Map it out, figure out our shots for tonight."

"Agreed," Nathan said. Five film students from University of Arizona, each here for different reasons. Him to document decay. Samantha to research. Kevin for technical work. Lisa for art. Greg because Nathan was his roommate.

They walked into the lot. The speaker posts created an eerie forest of metal, swinging in the breeze, producing that unsettling whistle. Lisa stopped at one, touching the rust-pitted metal.

"Families used to sit in their cars," she said quietly. "Everyone watching together."

"Greatest communal art form America ever produced," Nathan said. "And we killed it."

"Economics killed it," Kevin corrected. "Land values, operating costs."

The playground was next—skeletal jungle gym, swing set with just chains hanging. Samantha photographed while Nathan filmed. Behind them, the screen loomed, blocking the sunset.

"The booth," Greg said. "Should we check it out now?"

The projection booth sat on a raised platform, accessed by a half-rotted stairway. Rusted padlock, broken windows like empty eye sockets.

"Tomorrow," Nathan decided. "We've got twenty minutes of good light. Let's shoot establishing footage."

No one argued. Nathan saw relief on Greg's face. There was something about the booth that made him uneasy too.

They worked quickly. Screen, speaker posts, playground. Lisa filmed the entrance kiosk's faded prices: $3 per car, 50 cents per person. Samantha found broken film canisters behind the concession stand, ancient celluloid crumbling at her touch.

By the time they returned to camp, full darkness had fallen. The generator's lights created a bubble of illumination in the vast desert night. Beyond that bubble, the drive-in stretched away into shadows, speaker posts barely visible against the star-bright sky.

They gathered in the back room, sharing beers from the cooler and discussing the night's shooting plan. Nathan sketched out a shot list. Kevin checked battery levels and tested the audio equipment. Greg's recorder picked up interference—static and warbling that he tried to filter out, cursing the cheap cables he'd been forced to use.

"This place is going to look incredible on film," Samantha said, studying her notes. She'd brought a folder of research—clippings about the 1972 fire, about drive-in culture, about Dalton Reed. "The decay is just... it's perfect. Tragic but perfect."

"My grandfather used to come here," Greg said quietly. He was on his third beer, drinking faster than usual. "Before the fire. Said it was the best date spot in Tucson. He brought my grandmother here for their first anniversary."

"Did he know Reed? The projectionist?" Samantha asked, immediately interested.

Greg nodded. "A little. Said he was strange. Really obsessive about the movies. Would get angry if people talked during the show, even though they were in their own cars. My grandfather said Reed took it personal, like you were disrespecting something sacred."

"Sounds like film school," Kevin said dryly.

Nathan didn't laugh. "What else did he say?"

"That Reed got treated like shit by the owner. Guy named Rollins. Paid him almost nothing, blamed him when equipment broke, humiliated him in front of customers." Greg peeled at the label on his beer bottle. "My grandfather felt bad for him. Right up until Reed burned nine people alive."

The silence that followed was broken only by the generator's rumble and the wind whistling through distant speaker posts. Nathan found his gaze drawn to the booth again, visible through the broken window as a dark shape against the stars.

"We should get started," he said finally. "We're burning moonlight."

They gathered their equipment and stepped out into the October night, five young people preparing to document the death of a dream. None of them noticed, as they walked toward the screen, the shadow that moved in the projection booth window. None of them saw the figure watching from the darkness, gaunt and still, as they set up their cameras and lights.

The Stardust Drive-In had been waiting eleven years for an audience.

Finally, someone had arrived.
