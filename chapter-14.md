# Chapter 14: Regrouping

Nathan stared at the journal in Samantha's hands, trying to process what Lisa had just told them. Dalton Reed—alive, functional, living in the projection booth for eleven years. Talking to ghosts. Planning a screening. Inviting them to join his "audience."

"This can't be real," Greg said, but his voice lacked conviction. He'd seen Lisa's face when she stumbled in. Seen the terror. "She's mistaken. Saw some homeless guy, got scared—"

"I wasn't mistaken." Lisa's voice was hoarse but firm. "I saw the shrine. Nine photographs with candles and offerings. I read the journals—eleven years of entries. And I talked to him. Face to face. Dalton Reed is alive, and he's been waiting for us."

"Waiting for us specifically?" Kevin demanded. "Or just anyone who showed up?"

"Us specifically." Lisa wrapped her arms around herself, still shaking. "He watched us arrive. Listened to our conversations. He knows our names, Kevin. All of them. He catalogued us like he catalogues his films. 'The military one who thinks in tactics. The tall one who sees tragic beauty. The woman who analyzes patterns. The frightened one who grounds everything in fear.' He's studied each of us."

Nathan felt cold despite the desert heat building outside. Dalton Reed knew them. Had watched them work, heard them talk, analyzed their personalities like a director casting roles. They weren't random victims—they were specifically chosen.

"What did he say exactly?" Nathan asked. "His exact words about tonight? Try to remember everything."

Lisa closed her eyes, and Nathan could see her hands trembling as she recalled the encounter. "He said: 'Sundown. I'm preparing a special screening. I've chosen the perfect film—something that speaks to preservation, loss, nostalgia. You'll watch with the audience. All fourteen of us together. The faithful nine and the new five.'"

"Fourteen," Greg repeated. "Nine dead. Five living. He's already counted us as part of his collection."

"Five new members," Samantha read from the journal, voice shaking slightly. She'd found the entry, was reading it aloud. "'October 13, 1983. New visitors. Young cinema lovers. I can tell by how they handle equipment, how they frame shots. They understand film language. The audience insists I welcome them properly. Finally, real people who might appreciate the work. The audience has been patient so long. Now they're rewarded. Five new members.'"

She looked up. "He wrote this yesterday. Before we even knew he existed. He'd already decided."

"Then he knew we were coming," Kevin said. "How? We didn't tell anyone specifically where we were going. Just 'abandoned drive-in near Tucson.'"

Nathan's mind raced through the timeline. "Greg's grandfather. You said he worked here in the sixties. Knew Dalton. Warned you this place was cursed."

Greg nodded slowly, face going pale as he understood. "He thought Dalton died in the desert. Everyone did. But if Dalton's been here all along... if my grandfather ever came back, saw something, heard rumors..."

"Dalton might have been watching for years," Nathan finished. "Waiting for anyone connected to the fire to return. Your grandfather mentions the place to you, you mention it to me, word spreads. And Dalton hears somehow. Or he just watches the access road, waiting for anyone curious enough to show up."

"Like us," Lisa said quietly. "We walked right into a trap he's been setting for eleven years."

Samantha was flipping through the journal, reading entries at random. Her academic detachment was cracking, replaced by genuine horror. "Listen to this. January 1973: 'Showed Chinatown tonight. The Morrison children loved it. Sarah cried when the woman died. But Michael explained it's only acting.' He's having conversations with dead children. Detailed, specific conversations. And this—1979: 'Mr. Rollins apologized again for how he treated me. Said he was wrong to cut corners.' The man he murdered is apologizing to him in his delusion."

She set down the journal, hands shaking. "This isn't simple mental illness. This is a complete reconstructed reality that's been reinforced for over a decade. He's not just crazy—he's built an entire functional world where his actions were justified, where his victims love him, where everything he did was necessary."

"That's what he wants to do to us," Greg said, voice rising with panic. "Add us to that world. Make us permanent members of his fantasy audience. Like the nine victims."

"We don't know that," Nathan said, but the words felt hollow even as he spoke them.

"Don't we?" Kevin moved to the window, looking out at the projection booth sitting on its platform in the morning sun. "An arsonist who killed nine people invites us to a screening in the exact location of his crime. 'All fourteen of us together'—he's already counting us as part of his dead audience. What do you think happens when the film ends and we try to leave?"

Silence. Heavy, suffocating silence. No one wanted to voice the obvious conclusion—that Dalton Reed might be planning to create his perfect audience the same way he did in 1972.

With fire.

"He let me go," Lisa said finally. "He could have trapped me in the crawlspace. Killed me there. But he gave me space. Talked to me from below, never climbed up. Then he left. Told me to tell you all, to debate it, and said we'd come anyway because we're filmmakers."

"Manipulative bastard," Kevin muttered.

"Or desperate," Samantha countered. "Eleven years alone. Talking to ghosts because he has no one else. Maybe having real people—living witnesses who might understand his work—matters more than adding us to his collection."

"You're defending him," Kevin said flatly.

"I'm analyzing him. There's a difference." Samantha set down the journal. "Yes, he's dangerous. Yes, he's delusional. But his primary need isn't to kill—it's to be understood. Validated. He's maintained this theater for over a decade as an act of preservation. He wants someone to witness it before he dies."

"Then he can wait for archaeologists," Greg said. "We leave. Right now. Drive to Tucson, call the police, let them handle the homicidal movie projectionist."

Nathan looked at his crew. Greg terrified and ready to bolt. Kevin calculating risks with military precision. Samantha intellectually hooked despite the danger. Lisa traumatized but still clutching her camera, still documenting.

And himself—Nathan Pierce, documentary filmmaker, facing the choice between safety and the story of a lifetime.

"We vote," he said. "One more time. Final vote. Leave right now, or stay until sundown and attend the screening. Whatever the majority decides, we all commit to. No second-guessing."

"This is insane," Greg said.

"I know. Vote anyway."

They looked at each other. Five film students in an abandoned drive-in, being invited to watch a movie with a killer.

Kevin spoke first. "If we attend, we do it armed. Tire iron, wrenches, anything we can use as weapons. We position ourselves for quick exit. And at the first sign of threat—any sign—we fight our way out. Those are my non-negotiable conditions."

"Agreed," Nathan said.

"I want everything documented," Samantha added. "Audio, video, notes. If we're taking this risk, the footage needs to matter. Complete record of what we witnessed."

"That's why we're here," Nathan confirmed.

Lisa was quiet for a long moment. Then: "He knows where we sleep. Where we eat. How many of us there are. If he wanted us dead, we'd already be in danger. Maybe attending is actually safer than refusing. Shows we respect his work, his invitation."

"Or it's exactly what he wants," Kevin countered. "Gets us all in one location at his chosen time. Perfect kill box."

"Vote," Nathan said again. "Stay or go."

The room fell silent. Outside, wind whistled through the speaker posts—that low, constant moan they'd heard since arriving. In the distance, the projection booth sat on its concrete platform, waiting.

"I vote stay," Samantha said. "For documentation. For understanding. For capturing something unprecedented."

"Stay," Lisa said quietly. "If we run, we'll always wonder. And he'll still be out there, watching."

Greg closed his eyes. "You're all insane. But I'm not splitting up the group." He opened his eyes. "Stay. God help us."

Three for staying. Kevin and Nathan remained.

Kevin shook his head. "This violates every tactical principle I know. We're walking into a trap with full knowledge it's a trap." He looked at Nathan. "Your call. Tie-breaker."

Nathan thought about his thesis. The dying drive-in culture he wanted to preserve. The interviews he'd planned, the footage he needed, the story he came here to tell. And now—impossibly—there was more. A man who'd lived eleven years maintaining a theater for ghosts. Who'd killed to save something beautiful and spent a decade justifying it to the dead.

The greatest documentary footage imaginable.

Or their deaths.

"Before I vote," Nathan said, "we verify one thing. The van. Kevin, you found the distributor cap yesterday. We need to confirm it's actually fixed. That we can leave if we need to."

"Smart," Kevin said. "Very smart. Don't commit until we know we have an exit."

"Everyone comes," Nathan added. "We check the van together. If it works, if we can drive out right now, then we have a real choice. Stay or go becomes meaningful."

The group moved toward the door. Outside, the desert sun was climbing, temperature already pushing toward eighty. Six hours until sundown. Six hours until Dalton Reed expected his audience.

First, they needed to know if they could leave.

Or if they were already trapped.
