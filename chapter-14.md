# Chapter 14: Regrouping

Nathan couldn't stop replaying Dalton's words. "You're filmmakers. Documentarians. This is the greatest story you'll ever find."

The man was right. Infuriatingly, terrifyingly right.

They had six hours until sundown. Six hours to prepare, to plan, to decide if they were really doing this insane thing.

"We need a strategy," Kevin said. He'd taken charge immediately after Dalton left, moving into tactical mode. "If we're attending this screening—and I still think it's a terrible idea—we do it smart. Full documentation, defensive positioning, multiple exit routes."

"We should leave," Greg said for the tenth time. He was pacing, agitated. "Right now. While we can. Fix the van, drive out, never look back."

"And miss documenting the most important interview of our careers?" Samantha countered. She had her notes spread out, analyzing everything Dalton had said. "A man who's lived in isolation for eleven years, maintaining a drive-in theater for ghosts. Who else will ever get access to this?"

"Access to a murderer," Greg shot back. "Who wants to make us permanent audience members. Did we all collectively forget the part where he burned nine people alive?"

Nathan stood by the window, watching the projection booth. Dalton was up there somewhere, preparing. Choosing the perfect film, threading it through the projector, arranging his shrine. Creating the experience he'd promised.

"He could have killed us already," Nathan said quietly. "Multiple opportunities. Instead he's asking permission. Inviting us. That means something."

"It means he's manipulative," Kevin countered. "Building false trust before he springs the trap. Classic predator behavior."

"Or it means he genuinely wants to share something," Samantha said. "His life's work. The thing he's maintained for over a decade. Maybe having a real audience matters more than adding us to his ghost collection."

"You're romanticizing him," Lisa said. She'd been quiet since Dalton left, curled in the corner. "He's not misunderstood or tragic. He's delusional and dangerous."

"I know," Samantha admitted. "But understanding his delusion doesn't mean agreeing with it. Anthropologists study dangerous cultures. Psychologists interview serial killers. We're documentarians. This is what we do."

Nathan turned from the window. "Here's what I propose. We attend the screening. We film everything. We let him show us his 'masterpiece.' But we maintain control. We sit where we choose, we keep the van accessible, and at the first sign of danger, we abort."

"Define first sign," Kevin demanded.

"If he locks us in. If he produces weapons. If he starts talking about fire or purification or making us permanent. Anything that suggests transition from showing to trapping."

Kevin considered. "And we're armed. Not guns—we don't have them—but tools. Tire iron, wrenches, anything that can be used defensively. Everyone carries something."

"That might provoke him," Lisa said.

"Good. If our being armed makes him reconsider violence, that's exactly what we want."

"What if it just makes him more determined?" Samantha asked. "Proves we don't trust him, which breaks whatever rapport he's trying to build?"

They argued in circles, each position logical from its perspective. Kevin's tactical pragmatism versus Nathan's documentary ambition versus Samantha's academic curiosity versus Lisa's intuitive dread versus Greg's survival instinct.

No consensus. Just fractured positions held together by their vote to stay.

Nathan checked his watch. 11:47 AM. Six hours to sundown.

"We use the time to prepare," he decided. "Kevin, you plan defensive positions and exit routes. Samantha, you compile everything we know about Dalton—psychology, triggers, patterns. Lisa, inventory our supplies—food, water, equipment. Greg, you're with me. We're going to test the van."

"I thought we voted to stay for the screening," Greg said.

"We did. But we stay on our terms, with the ability to leave if needed. That means confirming the van works before we commit."

They split up. Kevin mapping the lot, identifying cover positions and escape routes. Samantha analyzing her research, looking for patterns that might predict Dalton's behavior. Lisa checking supplies with mechanical precision.

Nathan and Greg walked to the van. The desert sun was brutal now, temperature pushing toward ninety. The van sat where they'd left it, seemingly untouched.

Nathan checked the perimeter first—no new footprints, no signs of tampering. Popped the hood. The distributor cap Kevin had found was back in place, properly seated.

"Try starting it," Nathan said.

Greg climbed in the driver's seat. Turned the key. The engine turned over immediately, rumbling to life. Greg gave it gas, let it run. It sounded fine.

"Okay," Greg said. "We can drive. So let's drive. Right now. Forget the screening, forget the footage. Just leave."

Nathan wanted to. Part of him—the rational part, the survival-focused part—screamed to do exactly that. Get in the van, drive to Tucson, call police, let professionals handle the dangerous mentally ill man in the ruins.

But another part, the part that had driven him to film school and documentary work, couldn't let go. This story. This man. This impossible situation that no one would ever believe without evidence.

"After the screening," Nathan said. "We document this last piece, then we leave. I promise."

"Your promises don't mean shit if we're dead."

"Then make sure we're not. Stay alert, stay ready. But give me this. Give me the chance to finish what we started."

Greg killed the engine. "You're obsessed, you know that? This isn't about documentation anymore. It's about you needing the perfect ending for your thesis."

"Maybe," Nathan admitted. "But I can't walk away. Not when we're this close."

They returned to find Kevin had mapped a detailed tactical plan. Entry and exit routes, positioning during the screening, hand signals for abort. Military precision applied to watching a movie.

Samantha had profiled Dalton based on his words and behavior. "Narcissistic personality with delusional disorder. He needs validation, approval, to be understood. That's why he's spent years talking to ghosts—they can't disagree with him. Having real people who might validate his choices is intoxicating for him. But it's also terrifying. Because we might reject him, prove his delusion wrong."

"So how does he resolve that?" Nathan asked.

"Either we genuinely validate him—tell him his dedication was noble, his sacrifices meaningful—and he lets us leave happy. Or we reject him, threaten his delusion, and he..." She trailed off.

"Eliminates the threat," Kevin finished. "Makes us permanent. Dead people can't disagree."

"So we lie," Lisa said. "Tell him what he wants to hear. Play along with the delusion. Get through the screening, then leave."

"Can you do that?" Samantha asked. "Can you look at a man who burned nine people alive and tell him it was noble?"

Lisa was quiet for a long moment. "To survive? Yes."

Nathan felt sick. This was what his obsession had led to—his friends planning to validate a murderer's delusion to escape alive. If they'd left yesterday, none of this would be necessary.

But they hadn't left. And now they were committed.

The afternoon dragged. They ate sparingly from their dwindling supplies—crackers, canned soup heated on the camp stove, warm water from jugs that had been sitting in the desert heat. No one had much appetite. Fear sat heavy in all their stomachs, making food taste like ash.

Nathan filmed preparation footage. Kevin demonstrating exit routes, marking positions on a hand-drawn map. Samantha reviewing notes, cross-referencing Dalton's statements against her research on delusional disorders. Lisa methodically cleaning the camera lenses, hands shaking slightly despite her focused expression. Greg sitting by the window, chain-smoking, watching the booth for any sign of movement.

Documentary instinct capturing every moment. Nathan wondered if anyone would ever see this footage. If they'd survive to edit it. If it would end up as evidence in a murder investigation.

The thought made him set down the camera and pick up a tire iron. Just in case.

At 4:00 PM, Dalton could be seen moving supplies from various caches across the lot into the booth. Preparing thoroughly. At 4:30, smoke rose from behind the screen—cooking something, they realized. Making the screening an event. At 5:00, he began his final preparations in the booth itself.

At 5:30 PM, the projection booth came to life.

Lights in the windows. The mechanical clatter of the projector warming up. Through binoculars, Nathan could see Dalton moving inside, preparing with meticulous care.

At 5:45, Dalton emerged. He'd cleaned himself—hair wet and slicked back, beard trimmed, wearing what looked like a freshly washed version of his projectionist uniform. Still gaunt, still skeletal, but attempting presentation. Taking pride in his role.

He walked to the center of the lot and called out: "Fifteen minutes. Please take your seats. Tonight's feature is very special. You won't want to miss it."

Then he returned to the booth, leaving them to decide.

"Last chance," Kevin said. "We can still leave. Van works, we have the keys. Nobody would blame us."

Nathan looked at his crew. Greg terrified but loyal. Lisa broken but brave. Samantha fascinated despite fear. Kevin protective despite knowing it was wrong.

"We watch the film," Nathan said. "We document. Then we leave. All of us. Together."

They gathered their equipment. Cameras, lights, audio recorder. Tools concealed in jackets and bags. Moving as a unit toward the massive screen where chairs had been arranged.

Five seats, carefully positioned for optimal viewing.

And in the projection booth, Dalton Reed waited.

The final screening was about to begin.
