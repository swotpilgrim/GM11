# Chapter 10: Perimeter Check

Kevin waited until full sunrise before suggesting the perimeter check. He wanted clear visibility, no shadows for Dalton to hide in. The desert morning was bright and harsh, temperature already climbing toward ninety.

"I'm checking the grounds," he announced. "Systematic sweep, document any evidence of tampering or surveillance. Nathan, you're with me. Everyone else stays inside, maintains watch."

Nathan grabbed his camera. Greg and Samantha took up positions at the windows. Lisa looked like she hadn't slept at all, dark circles under her eyes.

Outside, Kevin moved tactically—scanning before committing, checking corners, maintaining situational awareness. The lot was empty and silent, speaker posts casting long shadows. But empty didn't mean safe.

The first evidence was obvious once he looked for it. Footprints in the dust near their snack bar door. Bare feet, large—size twelve if Kevin's estimate was right. The prints circled the building, approaching each window in turn.

"He was right here," Nathan said, filming the prints. "Last night, while we were inside."

Kevin followed the trail. The prints showed a pattern—approach window, pause (checking inside?), move to next window, repeat. A complete circuit of the building. Some prints were within three feet of the door.

"Look at this." Nathan pointed to fresh scratches on the door frame, near the handle. Thin marks, like someone had been testing the wood with a knife or tool. "He was examining our barricade."

"Assessing defenses," Kevin said. The tactical implications made his skin crawl. While they'd been reviewing footage and researching, Dalton had been outside analyzing how they'd fortified their position.

They moved to the van. Kevin had parked it facing out—standard protocol for quick evacuation—thirty yards from the snack bar. More footprints circled it. Not approaching randomly, but methodically. Driver's side, passenger side, rear doors, hood.

"He walked around it multiple times," Nathan observed, filming the pattern.

Kevin tried the driver's door. Unlocked—he'd left it that way deliberately, keys in his pocket. He popped the hood and immediately saw the problem.

The distributor cap was gone.

"Son of a bitch," Kevin breathed. He'd checked the van yesterday, confirmed it was operational. Sometime between then and now, Dalton had disabled it.

"Can you fix it?" Nathan asked.

"If I have the cap. It's not complicated—the cap just covers the distributor, directs spark to the right cylinder. Without it, engine won't fire." Kevin searched the engine compartment. Not there. Checked under the seats, in the back. Nothing.

"Maybe he destroyed it," Nathan suggested.

"Or hid it nearby. Sending a message—I control whether you leave." Kevin climbed out and scanned the area. If Dalton wanted them to find it eventually, he'd put it somewhere recoverable but not obvious.

He found it under the snack bar steps. Tucked in a shadow, placed carefully rather than thrown. The cap was intact, undamaged. Kevin could reinstall it in thirty seconds and they'd be mobile again.

But the message was clear: Dalton had accessed the van while they slept. Could have destroyed it, could have trapped them completely. Chose not to. Chose instead to demonstrate capability and control.

"He's playing with us," Nathan said quietly.

"No. He's establishing rules. 'I could trap you, but I'm not. Yet.'" Kevin pocketed the cap. "We need to understand his infrastructure. How he's survived here, where he moves, what resources he has access to."

They spread out, searching methodically. Kevin found the first cache behind the screen's support structure—a dugout, maybe six by eight feet, covered with a sheet of plywood camouflaged with dust and gravel. Inside: camping supplies, canned food (mix of old and recent), water jugs, a sleeping bag.

"Secondary shelter," Kevin noted. "In case the booth is compromised. He's got backup positions."

Nathan was filming everything. "How many locations does he have?"

"Unknown. But he's thought this through. Multiple caches, distributed resources. Classic survival strategy—don't keep everything in one place."

They found evidence of a false floor panel under the playground equipment. More film canisters hidden there, wrapped in plastic to protect from moisture. Rain catchment barrels behind the ruins of the snack bar's main section—50-gallon drums, quarter full from monsoon season.

"He's not just surviving," Nathan said, awed despite the situation. "He's thriving. Eleven years, and he's built an entire support system."

Kevin mapped it mentally. The booth as primary shelter, secondary positions scattered across the lot, resource caches hidden in structures. Paths between them using speaker posts and ruins for concealment. Someone watching from the booth could see the entire lot, track movements, predict patrol patterns.

They'd walked into his controlled environment. He had every advantage.

"Look at this," Nathan called from near the playground. He was crouched by a speaker post, examining the ground. Footprints—dozens of them, overlapping. "He uses these posts for navigation. Like a trail system."

Kevin studied the pattern. Posts were spaced every fifteen feet or so, arranged in curved rows. At night, with moonlight, someone who knew the layout could move between them invisibly—step behind post, cross to next post, always in shadow.

"Explains how he circled us without being seen," Kevin said. "Even when we were looking, he was always one post ahead, using geometry and shadow."

They found the observation point in the snack bar attic—the section of roof that hadn't collapsed. Access was through a partially hidden ladder behind the concession area. Kevin climbed up carefully, Nathan following.

The space was low-ceilinged but functional. Someone had created a nest here—blankets arranged to create a cushioned position, cigarette butts in a can (hand-rolled, from the look of them), and a clear view through gaps in the roof boards.

Direct sightline to their camp room.

"He watched us," Nathan said. "From right here. Listened to our conversations."

Kevin found evidence of recent use—the blankets still held body heat, absorbed from yesterday's sun. Cigarette butts from last night. Dalton had been up here while they slept, watching through the gaps.

"He knows everything we discussed," Kevin said. "Our plans, our fears, our arguments. He's been listening the whole time."

Nathan panned his camera across the space, documenting everything. "This is incredible. Horrifying, but incredible. The infrastructure of survival. A man living ghost-like in ruins for over a decade."

"A man who killed nine people and is now stalking five more," Kevin reminded him. "Don't romanticize this, Nathan."

"I'm not romanticizing. I'm documenting. There's a difference."

Kevin descended the ladder, frustrated. Nathan's documentarian instincts were overriding his survival instincts. Every discovery made Nathan more fascinated, more committed to staying, more convinced this was the story that would define his career.

And maybe it would. If they survived.

At the van, Kevin stood looking back at the drive-in. The booth on its platform, the massive screen, the rows of dead speaker posts. Dalton's domain, built from ruins and maintained through obsession.

"We should leave," he said. "Reinstall the cap, drive to the highway, call police. We have documentation, we have evidence. Let authorities handle this."

"And miss the opportunity to interview him?" Nathan countered. "To hear his story directly? Kevin, when will we ever have access like this again?"

"Hopefully never. Access to mentally unstable murderers isn't usually a career goal."

"He hasn't hurt us."

"Yet. He hasn't hurt us yet." Kevin faced Nathan directly. "He disabled our van. Circled our shelter while we slept. Listened to our conversations. These are predatory behaviors, Nathan. Predators stalk prey before they attack."

"Or he's just... watching. Observing. Maybe he's as scared of us as we are of him."

"You think that?" Kevin gestured at the evidence around them—the caches, the paths, the observation point. "This is the work of someone completely in control. He's not scared. He's comfortable. This is his territory, and we're guests who'll leave when he's ready for us to leave."

Nathan was quiet for a moment. Then: "What if we approach him directly? Not as a threat, but as… documentarians. Researchers. Tell him we want to hear his side of the story."

"That's insane."

"Is it? He's clearly been trying to communicate. The film screening was a message. His positioning in our footage—he wanted to be seen. Maybe he wants to talk."

"Or maybe he wants victims," Kevin said bluntly.

But even as he said it, doubt crept in. Dalton had multiple opportunities to harm them. The booth confrontation—they'd been trapped in the crawlspace, vulnerable. The van—he could have slashed tires, destroyed critical components. Instead he'd removed one easily-replaced part and left it where they'd find it.

Control, yes. But measured control. Someone who wanted to keep them here, not hurt them. Not yet, anyway.

"We bring it to the group," Kevin decided. "Present everything we found, discuss options collectively. I'm not making this call alone."

They returned to the snack bar. Inside, Greg, Samantha, and Lisa waited with visible tension.

"Well?" Samantha asked.

Kevin laid out the discoveries. The footprints, the disabled van, the infrastructure, the observation point. Each piece of evidence made the situation clearer: they were mice in a maze, and the maze's architect was watching every move.

"So we're trapped," Greg said flatly.

"Not trapped. The van's repairable. But he knows we're thinking about leaving. He's monitoring us."

"Then we leave now," Lisa said. "Right now. Before he stops us permanently."

"Or we stay," Nathan said. "Document properly. Try to make contact. Understand who he really is."

"We know who he is," Greg shot back. "A killer who's been living like a hermit for eleven years. What else do we need to know?"

Nathan looked at Kevin. "You're the tactical expert. What's the actual threat level?"

Kevin considered carefully. His training said evacuate. But his observations showed something more complex than a simple threat.

"He's dangerous," Kevin said slowly. "Capable, intelligent, and in complete control of this environment. But his behavior isn't overtly hostile. It's... performative. Like he's staging something and we're the audience." He paused. "I can't guarantee our safety if we stay. But I also can't say we're in immediate danger. It's ambiguous."

"I hate ambiguous," Greg muttered.

"We all do," Kevin agreed. "But that's where we are. In the territory of a man who might be harmless or might be waiting for the right moment. And we have to decide what we do about it."

Outside, the desert sun climbed higher. Somewhere in the ruins, Dalton Reed watched and waited.

The show was far from over.

And they still didn't know how it would end.
