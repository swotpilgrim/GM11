# Chapter 19: Talking to Ghosts

Samantha had watched plenty of films about madness. Studied them academically, written papers analyzing how cinema portrayed mental illness. But she'd never sat next to actual insanity before, watching it perform in real time.

Dalton Reed was having a conversation.

Thirty minutes into Don't Look Now, during a quiet scene where Donald Sutherland's character walked alone through Venice's narrow streets, Dalton chuckled softly and turned to his right—toward the empty lot, toward speaker posts standing silent in the darkness.

"Yes, Mrs. Morrison, the cinematography is extraordinary. Venice becomes a character itself, not just a setting. Roeg understands that place shapes psychology."

He paused, listening to silence.

"I agree completely. The use of red as a recurring motif—the daughter's raincoat, the recurring figure—represents both memory and warning. The past and future collapsing into the present."

Another pause. His expression shifted to delight.

"Absolutely right. The editing is non-linear to mirror how trauma disrupts chronology. Grief doesn't happen in sequence. It jumps around, repeats, intrudes."

Samantha's skin crawled. Dalton wasn't just talking to himself. He was listening, responding, engaging in dialogue with someone who wasn't there. His responses were too specific, too timed, to be soliloquy. In his mind, Mrs. Morrison was really there, really speaking to him.

Nathan filmed it, camera catching Dalton's profile lit by the screen. Greg's audio recorder sat on his lap, running.

On screen, Julie Christie's character consulted psychics, desperate to contact her dead daughter. The parallel was almost too on-the-nose.

Dalton offered invisible popcorn to his right, hand miming a scoop, holding it out to empty air. "I know, too much butter. But it's a special occasion."

He held the pantomime for several seconds, as if someone was taking popcorn from his hand.

Then he turned left, toward different darkness. "Miguel! Rosa! Are you enjoying the film? I know there's a lot of English dialogue, but Roeg's visual storytelling transcends language."

He listened to silence, then nodded enthusiastically.

"I'm so glad. Yes, the Venice architecture is spectacular. Have you been? No? Someday, perhaps. Though cinema is almost as good—better, in some ways. Cinema lets us experience places more intensely than travel."

Kevin leaned close, whisper barely audible. "We need to leave. Now. This man is disconnected from reality."

"We can't. Van's disabled. Twenty miles. He'd track us down before dawn."

"Then we jump him. Five against one."

"Five against one with a gun, who knows this terrain, who has nothing left to lose." Samantha kept her eyes on the screen. "Our best chance is playing along, waiting for an opportunity."

"And if no opportunity comes?"

Samantha didn't answer.

On screen, the film built toward its climax. The red-coated figure appearing in photographs, moving through Venice like a ghost, leading Sutherland toward his death. Inevitable doom thickened with every scene.

Dalton was completely absorbed, leaning forward, eyes tracking every detail, occasionally mouthing dialogue. His passion was genuine. That was the tragedy. This wasn't a monster who happened to love film. This was a film lover whose love had curdled into madness.

During a particularly tense sequence, Dalton reached out and touched empty air—a comforting gesture, as if patting someone's shoulder.

"Don't worry," he said softly. "It's frightening, yes, but it's meant to be. Horror films let us confront death safely, process our fear through narrative. This is catharsis, not trauma."

The tender care in his voice made Samantha's chest tight. He was comforting the children he'd murdered. The Morrison kids who'd burned to death in their family's station wagon. He genuinely believed they were there, watching with him, needing reassurance during scary scenes.

"How did you end up here?"

The question slipped out before Samantha could stop herself. Dalton turned to her, pulled from his conversation with ghosts.

"I'm sorry?"

"This place. Eleven years. How did..." She searched for words that wouldn't trigger rage. "How did you manage?"

Dalton's expression softened. He looked almost grateful to be asked, to have someone interested in his story beyond judgment.

"At first I was just hiding. After the fire, I ran. Walked into the desert planning to die out there. The guilt was..." He paused, throat working. "Unbearable."

The honesty startled her. This was a different voice—not the theatrical announcer, but something raw underneath.

"I made it maybe five miles before I realized I couldn't do it. Couldn't just die and leave... leave them unavenged."

"Unavenged?" Nathan asked.

"Rollins." Dalton's voice hardened. "What he did to this place. To cinema. Cutting corners, playing cheap trash, treating the Stardust like a money machine instead of a temple. I tried talking to him. Explaining. But he didn't care about art, about community, about preserving something beautiful."

He gestured to the lot. "This was a gathering place. Families came here, made memories here. And he was killing it with greed. So I..." He trailed off.

"You killed him instead," Kevin said flatly.

Dalton flinched. "I stopped him. I lit a small fire in the booth to make a point, to show him what he was destroying. But it spread too fast. The film stock—nitrate ignited like gunpowder. I tried to get everyone out, tried to warn them, but..."

"Nine people died." Kevin's voice was hard.

"I know." Dalton's whisper was anguished. "I know exactly how many. I see them every night."

"You see ghosts," Kevin said. "You're delusional."

"Kevin—" Samantha started.

But Dalton shook his head, surprisingly calm. "You're the skeptic. I understand. I was too, once. But I've lived here eleven years, alone except for them. And they came back, you see. About a week after I returned to the ruins. I was sitting where the screen is now, trying to work up courage to hang myself, and I heard Frank Morrison's voice. Clear as day. He said, 'Dalton, the projector needs maintenance.'"

Dalton's eyes were distant.

"I thought I was hallucinating. But then I heard the children playing on the playground equipment. Heard Rosa Delgado humming. Heard Mr. Rollins complaining." He smiled sadly. "And I realized they'd come back. They'd forgiven me. They wanted me to keep doing what I did best."

"So you've been playing movies for ghosts," Greg said. His voice shook.

"For the faithful." Dalton turned back to the screen. "The ones who understand what cinema means. What's worth preserving, even at terrible cost."

Samantha's mind raced. This was the core delusion—a carefully constructed narrative where Dalton's crime became sacrifice, his victims became congregation, his isolation became holy devotion. Elegant psychological architecture. And absolutely terrifying.

"Do they talk to you every night?" she asked, keeping her tone academic, curious.

"During screenings, yes. That's when they're most present. The ritual of gathering, watching together—that's when the veil thins." He glanced at her. "You must feel it too. The presence. The sense that this lot isn't empty."

Before Samantha could answer, he turned to the darkness again.

"What's that, Frank? Oh, you're right. I'm being rude, monopolizing the conversation when our guests might have questions."

He'd just heard from Frank Morrison, received feedback, and was adjusting based on ghostly social cues. The complexity of the delusion was staggering.

"Your friend raises an interesting point," Dalton said to Nathan, as if Frank had really spoken. "He says I'm being selfish, playing my favorite films instead of taking requests. He's right. Would you like to suggest a film for tomorrow night? I have quite an extensive collection."

The casual invitation chilled Samantha. Tomorrow night. He was planning their captivity long-term. He intended to keep them here, integrate them into his ghostly audience.

"We have commitments," Kevin said. "School. Work. People expecting us back."

"Oh, they won't mind waiting." Dalton waved dismissively. "What's a few days when weighed against experiencing true cinema? The outside world can wait. They've got their televisions and their multiplexes. But here, here we have something pure."

Lisa had been silent since they sat down, but now she spoke: "Do they forgive you? The people you killed? Do they really?"

Dalton turned to her with unexpected tenderness. "You're the sensitive one. You can feel them, can't you?"

"I feel something," Lisa whispered. "But I don't know if it's ghosts or just... wrongness."

"It's grace," Dalton said. "The grace of the dead who understand that art requires sacrifice. Every great work of beauty has a body count, you see. The workers who died building cathedrals, the actors who suffered for their craft, the artists who gave everything for their vision." He gestured to the lot. "The Stardust is my cathedral. The nine are my martyrs. And I tend their memory every night."

"That's insane," Kevin said. "You can't justify mass murder with film theory."

For a moment, something dangerous flickered in Dalton's eyes. Then he laughed—a genuine, amused sound.

"You remind me of Rollins. He said the same thing. 'It's just movies, Dalton. Just entertainment. Not worth obsessing over.' He didn't understand that cinema is the defining artform of our age, that these images shape how we understand ourselves, that preserving them is sacred work."

He leaned forward, intense. "When the Stardust burns—and it will, everything burns eventually—what will remain? Shopping malls. Television. Isolation. But for eleven years I've held the line. I've kept the temple open. I've maintained the ritual of communal viewing. And the faithful have rewarded me with their presence."

The film reached its climax. Sutherland cornering the red-coated figure, discovering it wasn't his dead daughter but something terrible, the knife flashing. The moment of horrible revelation.

Dalton gasped, grabbed invisible shoulders on either side of him. "Don't look! Children, cover your eyes for this part. It's too intense."

He pantomimed shielding young faces from the screen. Protecting the Morrison children from cinematic violence. The children he'd killed with actual fire.

Samantha looked at Nathan. His face was pale in the screen's glow, camera still running, documenting this surreal tableau. They were watching a man tend to ghosts like they were real, comfortable in delusion, fully inhabited by a reality that existed nowhere except in his shattered mind.

And somewhere in the darkness, nine speaker posts stood silent.

Or not silent.

Because Greg's audio recorder was picking up something. Samantha could see it on his face—the shock, the disbelief as he checked his levels, adjusted his headphones, tried to rationalize what he was hearing.

When he caught her looking, he mouthed two words:

Nine voices.

On screen, Sutherland died in Venice, his death foreseen and inevitable, the red-coated figure disappearing into darkness. The film ended on a note of ambiguous horror—was the figure supernatural or human? The movie never confirmed.

The credits rolled.

Dalton stood and applauded. "Magnificent! What a film. What a perfect marriage of form and content."

And from the empty lot, impossible yet undeniable, came other hands clapping.

The ghost audience, approving the show.

Or something far worse.
