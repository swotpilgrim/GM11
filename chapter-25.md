# Chapter 25: Evacuation

The van had been found intact, parked behind the snack bar where Dalton had disabled it days earlier. The distributor cap was back in place, quarter tank of gas still in the system. He'd intended them to use it—either to drive to safety or to drive to their deaths, depending on when the final screening happened.

Now it would carry them home.

Nathan sat in the passenger seat while Kevin drove, following the sheriff's escort down the access road toward Highway 10. Behind them, Samantha, Lisa, and Greg rode in silence, still processing. The parents had wanted them to ride separately, get immediate medical attention at Tucson Medical Center. But the five students had insisted on staying together, at least for the drive back.

They'd been through something none of their families could understand. They needed these final hours with people who'd been there.

The access road stretched long and empty, cutting through creosote scrub toward the highway. In the rearview mirror, Nathan watched the smoke from the Stardust fade into the distance. By tonight it would be invisible. By tomorrow, just another desert ruin being catalogued by authorities.

"We made it," Lisa said quietly. "We actually made it out."

"Thanks to you three running," Nathan said. "If you hadn't flagged down that trucker—"

"You'd have fought Dalton anyway," Samantha finished. "And probably died doing it."

Probably. Nathan thought about those final moments—Kevin tackling Dalton, Nathan grabbing the gun, the decision to rush into a burning building for projector parts. Stupid decisions made in crisis, any of which could have killed him.

But they hadn't. Against odds, all five had survived.

Greg stared out the window, watching desert pass. He hadn't said much since the sheriff found them. Shock, the paramedics suggested. Or relief so overwhelming it paralyzed.

"I'm never watching another movie," he said suddenly. "Never. Fuck cinema, fuck documentaries, fuck all of it."

Nobody argued. They all understood.

The highway appeared ahead, shimmering in afternoon heat. Real civilization—cars, trucks, the truck stop where Samantha and Lisa and Greg had found help. They'd run ten miles through desert at dawn, dehydrated and terrified, and somehow survived. The human body was more resilient than Nathan had imagined.

Kevin merged onto the highway, following the sheriff's cruiser toward Tucson. The drive would take maybe forty minutes at highway speed. Forty minutes to process two days of madness before seeing their families again, before giving formal statements, before becoming part of an official investigation.

"What are we going to tell people?" Lisa asked. "About what we saw. The things that don't make sense."

"The truth," Kevin said. "Dalton Reed, the 1972 arsonist, was living in the ruins. He held us hostage, planned to burn us alive. We escaped. He died in the fire he started. That's the story."

"And the other part?" Lisa pressed. "The voices. The... presences."

"Delusion. Shared trauma. Brains creating patterns from chaos." Kevin's voice was firm. "We don't mention ghosts because there were no ghosts. Just a sick man who'd been alone too long."

But Samantha shook her head. "The footage will show what it shows. Greg's audio has those voices. Nathan's camera might have captured things. We can't control how people interpret it."

"So we let them interpret," Nathan said. "We provide evidence. Let others decide what's real."

It was the documentarian's answer. Show, don't tell. Present facts, allow ambiguity. The Stardust had burned, Dalton had died, and whether his ghost congregation existed was a question Nathan couldn't answer.

The footage would be his statement. Everything else was commentary.

They drove in silence for a while, the van's engine humming, air conditioning fighting losing battle against desert heat. The burns on Nathan's hands throbbed. His lungs ached from smoke. His body was cataloguing damage, sending pain signals he'd ignored during crisis.

He'd be feeling this for weeks. They all would.

"I saw my grandfather," Greg said abruptly. "When we were running. In the desert. He was standing by a joshua tree, watching us pass. Wearing the same clothes he wore to his funeral."

Everyone went quiet.

"Heat hallucination," Kevin said, but his voice was gentler.

"Maybe. Or maybe he was there. Making sure we got out." Greg wiped his eyes. "He warned me about the Stardust. Said it was cursed. I didn't listen."

"We all chose to go," Nathan said. "This isn't on you."

"Isn't it? I could have refused. Could have walked away when you first suggested the documentary." Greg's laugh was bitter. "But I needed the money. Fifty bucks to be production assistant on Nathan's thesis film. Great deal, right?"

"Greg—"

"I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying we all made choices. And now we live with them."

The truck stop appeared on the right—the same one where they'd stopped for supplies on the way to the Stardust. Was that really only three days ago? It felt like months. Nathan had been a different person then. Naive, romantic, obsessed with capturing dying Americana on film.

Now he was someone who'd held a gun on another human being. Someone who'd watched a man burn to death. Someone who carried footage of genuine horror, not just atmospheric decay.

The documentary he'd wanted to make was nothing like the documentary he'd created.

Kevin pulled into a rest area, needing gas and a bathroom break. The sheriff's escort waited, giving them space. As Kevin fueled up, the other four stood in the shade of the station's overhang, drinking Cokes from a vending machine.

"What happens to the footage?" Lisa asked Nathan.

"Evidence first. Then... I don't know. Maybe I finish the documentary. Maybe I bury it." He'd been thinking about this since the firefighters arrived. "Part of me wants to show the world what happened. Document the whole thing, from arrival to escape. Make people understand what obsession and isolation can do to a person."

"And the other part?"

"Wants to forget any of this happened."

Samantha finished her Coke, crushed the can. "You'll finish it. You're a documentarian. This is the story you went looking for—just darker than you expected. You'll edit the footage, submit it to festivals, probably win awards."

"That feels gross. Profiting from trauma."

"Welcome to documentary filmmaking." Her smile was sad. "Every great doc exploits someone's pain. You just happened to live it instead of observing it."

Nathan thought about the footage—the screening, Dalton talking to ghosts, the gun revealed, the fire. Powerful images. Compelling narrative. Festival programmers would eat it up. Critics would write essays about the ambiguous supernatural elements, about cinema's relationship to madness, about the death of drive-in culture.

And at the center: Dalton Reed, a man who loved films so much he killed for them.

"I don't know," Nathan said. "Ask me again in a few months."

Kevin finished fueling, waved them back to the van. The last leg to Tucson awaited. Families, hospitals, statements, news interviews. The whole machinery of aftermath.

They climbed back in, Kevin started the engine, and they pulled onto the highway.

Tucson appeared on the horizon—a sprawl of buildings and civilization after two days in the desert. The university campus would be visible soon, their dorm rooms, the film department where Nathan had borrowed equipment. Normal life waiting to resume.

Except nothing would be normal again.

"We should stay in touch," Samantha said as they entered Tucson's outskirts. "After this. Make sure we're all okay."

Everyone agreed, though Nathan wondered if they'd actually do it. Shared trauma bonded people, but it also reminded them of things they'd rather forget. Would they want to see each other and remember the Stardust? Or avoid each other to avoid the memories?

Time would tell.

The sheriff's cruiser led them to Tucson Medical Center, where ambulances waited and families gathered. Nathan's parents rushed the van the moment it stopped, pulling him into their arms before he'd even unbuckled.

"We're okay," he kept saying. "We're all okay."

But his mother saw his bandaged hands, smelled smoke in his clothes, noticed the haunted look in his eyes. She knew he wasn't okay. None of them were.

The paramedics took them inside—routine examination, smoke inhalation treatment, documentation of injuries for the record. Nathan sat in an exam room getting his burns re-dressed while his father paced and his mother cried quietly in a chair.

"The sheriff said you were kidnapped," his father said. "By the man who killed those people in '72."

"Yeah."

"And he tried to burn you alive."

"Yeah."

"But you're okay."

Nathan looked at his bandaged hands, thought about Dalton's silhouette in the flames, remembered nine shapes watching the final show.

"I'm alive," he said. "That's not the same as okay."

His father nodded slowly, understanding what Nathan wasn't saying. Some experiences changed you forever. Coming home didn't erase what you'd seen.

Through the exam room window, Nathan could see the others with their families. Lisa wrapped in her mother's arms. Greg surrounded by aunts and uncles. Samantha talking with her mom, animated despite exhaustion. Kevin standing apart, his father's hand on his shoulder.

They'd survived. That was something.

The rest—the processing, the healing, the slow return to normalcy—would take time.

The doctor cleared Nathan for release. No permanent damage from smoke, burns would heal in a few weeks, no signs of serious trauma beyond the psychological.

"Follow up with a therapist," she suggested. "Experiences like this can have delayed effects."

Nathan nodded, knowing he probably wouldn't. He'd process this the way he processed everything—through his work. Edit the footage, shape the narrative, turn trauma into art.

It's what documentarians did.

Outside the hospital, the sun was setting. Orange light painting the desert gold. In twenty miles, the Stardust ruins still smoldered, investigators still sifted through ash.

But here in Tucson, life continued. Traffic hummed, people went about their evenings, the world turned like nothing had happened.

Because for most people, nothing had.

Five students knew differently.

They'd been to the Stardust Drive-In, and they'd come back changed.

Whether they'd ever truly leave it behind remained to be seen.
