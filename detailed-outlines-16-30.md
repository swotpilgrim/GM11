Now everyone watches alone on televisions. They murdered this." Paces, agitated. "I tried showing them in '72. Fire was symbolic—purification, rebirth. They called it murder. They don't understand art requires sacrifice." Samantha carefully asks what he wants. Dalton smiles. "To witness. Document. You're filmmakers—you understand. Tomorrow night, my masterpiece. Final show. You'll film it, show world what cinema means. What it's worth dying for." Greg stands to run. Dalton produces revolver from vest. "Please sit. Audience insists."

* **Beats:** Dalton herds them at gunpoint into snack bar storage room, locks heavy door. "I need time to prepare. Screening must be perfect. You're honored guests, not prisoners." Locks door from outside. Windowless concrete, no escape. Kevin searches: solid door, exterior hinges. Greg hyperventilates, Lisa cries, Nathan/Samantha process—his "masterpiece" means recreating fire with them as victims, filming it as deranged statement. Kevin finds ventilation grate too small.

**Setting:** Motel room
**Time:** Three days after fire, evening

* **Purpose:** Review footage revealing ambiguous supernatural evidence—silhouettes around Dalton, ghost voices on audio.

* **Beats:** Footage screening in motel. Surreal—Nathan's camera captured booth confrontation, fight, fire starting. But captured more: as Dalton burns refusing to leave, camera sees shapes around him. Silhouettes like people, arranged as seated. Transparent, flickering—could be smoke and flame, or nine victims watching. Greg's audio during fire worse: underneath roar and shouting, multiple voices. Laughter. Applause. Woman: "Beautiful show, Dalton." Child: "Do it again!" Voices overlap, phantom audience cheering fire. Kevin argues audio artifacts, heat affecting equipment. But nine distinct voices matching victim count. Lisa speaks first time in days: "They were there. I saw them in booth window. They forgave him." Samantha doesn't know what to believe.

**Time:** Two months later, November 1983

* **Purpose:** Nathan completes documentary omitting supernatural elements, wins awards but feels hollow, confronts exploitation and ethics.

Focuses on drive-in culture death, interviews with former Stardust employees/customers, historical context on 1972 fire, their discovery of Dalton's survival. Omits supernatural elements, ghost voices, inexplicable footage. Tragic human story: man destroyed by obsession and isolation. Film powerful, elegiac, respectful to victims and Dalton. Submits to festivals. Accepted to three, wins award at small New Mexico festival. But Nathan feels hollow. Awards mean nothing. Exploited tragedy for thesis. People died—including Dalton, mentally ill needing help not confrontation. Samantha argues they documented truth, preserved memory. Lisa says victims wanted story told—ghosts guided them there. Kevin says belief doesn't matter; preventing next Dalton matters.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Editorial choices. Festival screenings and reception. Awards significance. Exploitation versus documentation. What they owe victims and Dalton.

* **Purpose:** Show group scattered and changed by experience, final destruction of site, lingering supernatural hint.

* **Beats:** Spring 1984. Group scattered. Nathan graduated, moved to Los Angeles, production assistant, hasn't touched camera since. Samantha in grad school for film history, thesis on cinema and mental illness. Kevin returned to TV station, refuses to discuss Stardust. Greg dropped out, construction full-time, won't watch movies. Lisa transferred schools, studying painting instead of film. Minimal contact—experience bonded and broke them simultaneously. Nathan receives letter from Samantha: Stardust site sold to developers, will be demolished for strip mall. Thinks they should witness the end. Nathan refuses. She goes alone with camera. Films bulldozers tearing down screen, booth remains hauled away, speaker posts uprooted. Desert reclaiming lot. Final closure. Leaving at dusk, her camera malfunctions. Batteries die.

**Setting:** Former Stardust site, present day
**Time:** Present day, various times

* **Purpose:** Denouement establishing legend, ambiguous ongoing haunting, eternal screening for audience that may exist.

* **Beats:** Present day. Stardust site now shopping center: chain stores, parking lot, historical marker only. But locals share stories. Some nights, people see glow in empty lot behind stores. Like projection beam hitting nothing. No source, just light illuminating air. Some hear music, voices, laughter. Teenagers dare each other to visit after dark. Most see nothing. A few report same vision: rows of translucent cars filled with people, watching film that isn't there. Gaunt figure in projection beam operating equipment that doesn't exist, playing eternal show for audience that may or may not be ghosts. Footage eventually leaked online, including supernatural elements Nathan cut. Urban legend now, debated on paranormal forums. Some believe, some don't. Truth remains ambiguous. Cinema was Dalton Reed's religion. Perhaps in death he found eternal congregation. The show goes on.

* **Dialogue Topics:** (Online forums) Debate about footage authenticity. (Local interviews) Sightings and skepticism. (News) Historical marker dedication.

* **Emotional Arc:** Time dissolving into legend. Horror becoming folklore. Ambiguity preserved eternally. Bittersweet ending—Dalton got his wish, or nothing remains.

* **Key Details:** Strip mall: Stardust Plaza, opened 1985. Stores: Target, Walgreens, Starbucks. Historical marker: "Site of Stardust Drive-In 1958-1972." Sightings: documented 30+ times 1985-present. Online footage: leaked 1998, viewed 2.1 million times. Projection beam: reported always on October nights, anniversary week of original fire.
