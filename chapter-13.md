# Chapter 13: Dalton Reveals Himself

The decision was made: they would attempt contact. Controlled, careful, with Kevin and Nathan taking the lead while the others stayed back. Not an ambush, not a confrontation—an interview. Nathan's camera rolling, documenting everything.

They were preparing equipment when the voice came from outside.

"You found my home."

Everyone froze. The voice was male, cultured, strained—like vocal cords damaged by years of disuse being forced back into service. It came from just beyond the broken window, close enough to be conversational but not threatening.

Lisa moved to see. The others followed, maintaining distance from the window.

Dalton Reed stood fifteen feet from the snack bar, in full view. Morning sunlight made him starkly visible—every rib showing through his ragged shirt, wild hair and beard sun-bleached and tangled, bare feet calloused to leather. But it was his face that stopped Lisa's breath. Gaunt to the point of skull-like, but the eyes were sharp. Aware. Intelligent.

He looked directly at the window. Directly at them.

"I saw you filming," he said. His voice had an odd cadence, theatrical. Like he was performing lines. "The young woman with the artist's eye. You understand light. Composition. The way morning transforms decay into beauty."

He was talking about Lisa. About her filming at sunrise.

"You've been watching us," Nathan said. Not a question.

"Of course." Dalton smiled, revealing stained teeth. "This is my theater. I watch all my guests. You're filmmakers. Documentary artists, from your equipment. Preservationists of a dying age." He gestured at the ruins around them. "Like me."

"We're nothing like you," Greg called out.

Dalton's smile didn't fade. "The nervous one. You're afraid. That's wise. Fear sharpens appreciation. Makes you pay attention."

"What do you want?" Kevin demanded. Command voice, trying to establish control.

"The military one," Dalton observed. "You think this is a tactical situation. It isn't. This is theater. I'm the projectionist. You're the audience." He stepped closer, and Kevin moved to block the door. Dalton stopped, hands raised peacefully. "I don't want to hurt you. I want to show you."

"Show us what?" Samantha asked.

"The notebook one. Research, analysis, patterns. You understand storytelling structure." Dalton's eyes moved across each of them, cataloging. "You're all perfect. Different types of appreciation. The leader who sees beauty in ruins. The scholar who seeks narrative. The skeptic who demands proof. The sensitive one who feels rather than thinks. The frightened one who grounds truth through fear." He nodded, satisfied. "Complete cast. Ready audience."

Lisa found her voice. "You wrote about us. In your journal. 'Five new members.'"

Dalton's expression softened. "You read my work. How wonderful. Yes, five new members. The audience has been incomplete for so long. Nine faithful souls, but they hunger for company. For fresh perspective. New eyes to see the films. New hearts to feel them."

"They're dead," Nathan said carefully. "The nine people. They died in 1972."

"They're eternal," Dalton corrected gently. "Death purified them. Removed the distractions of living—bills, work, the outside world. Now they exist only for cinema. Pure appreciation. Perfect audience." He looked at Lisa. "You felt it in the shrine, didn't you? The devotion. The love."

Lisa's mouth was dry. "You killed them."

"I freed them." Dalton's voice carried absolute conviction. "Jack Rollins destroyed this place. Greed and shortcuts, commerce over art. He was killing cinema one cheap film at a time. Someone had to make a stand. Had to show that some things are worth dying for."

"So you burned them alive," Kevin said flatly.

Dalton flinched. "The fire was necessary. Purification. But I never wanted them to suffer. I thought they'd leave, understand the message. But they stayed. Watched the flames come. And when they died..." His voice dropped to a whisper. "They forgave me. I hear them every night. 'Thank you, Dalton. You saved us from lives wasted on meaningless consumption. Now we watch forever.'"

The delusion was complete. Total. Lisa could see it in his eyes—he truly believed the nine people he'd murdered spoke to him, approved of him, loved him for what he'd done.

"That's not real," Samantha said gently. "You know that's not real, right? You're alone here. Have been for eleven years. The voices are in your head."

Dalton laughed. Not maniacal, but genuinely amused. "Is a voice in your head less real than a voice in your ear? They speak. I listen. We discuss film. What does it matter where the sound originates?"

He moved closer, and Kevin tensed. But Dalton just sat down on the dirt, cross-legged, like a teacher preparing for a lecture. His hands rested on his knees—skeletal fingers, two missing from the left hand. Lisa saw old scars from some accident long before the fire.

"This was a cathedral," Dalton said, his voice taking on a reverent quality. "Do you understand? Families came here every Friday night. Not for the stories—you could see those on television. They came for the experience. Communal dreaming under stars. Strangers sharing laughter and tears, connected by flickering light. That's sacred. That's what humanity created to replace religion—shared narrative in darkness."

He looked at the massive screen behind him.

"Rollins didn't understand. To him, it was business. When attendance dropped, he cut quality. Cheaper films, shorter seasons, deferred maintenance. He was murdering something beautiful to squeeze out profit." Dalton's hands clenched. "I begged him. Showed him the numbers—how quality programming would bring people back. But he wouldn't listen. Said I was just a projectionist, that I didn't understand commerce."

"So you killed him," Nathan said.

"I saved the theater," Dalton corrected. "Showed him and everyone what dedication meant. That some people would rather burn than watch art die." He looked at them earnestly. "I never meant for the others to die. Just Rollins. Just the man who was destroying it. But they stayed. Watched. And when they became the audience..." He smiled. "They understood finally. What it means to give yourself completely to cinema."

Lisa realized she was shaking. The logic was insane, but Dalton delivered it with complete sincerity. He truly believed he'd done something noble. Sacrificed for art. Created the perfect audience through murder.

"You want to add us to it," she said quietly. "Five new members. Make us permanent like them."

Dalton stood, brushing dust from his ragged uniform. "I want to show you first. Tonight. Sundown. A special screening. I've chosen the perfect film—something that speaks to preservation, loss, nostalgia. You'll watch with the audience. All fourteen of us together."

"We're not staying for a film," Kevin said.

"Please." Dalton's voice took on a pleading quality. "Just one screening. Let me share what I've maintained for eleven years. If you still want to leave after, I won't stop you. But give me this—one chance to show real people, living people, what I've built. What the audience means."

He was lying. Lisa knew it with absolute certainty. One screening wouldn't be enough. Wouldn't satisfy him. He'd spent eleven years with a ghost audience. Having real people would only make him desperate to keep them.

"Tonight," Dalton repeated. "Sundown. I'll prepare everything. Please, honor me with your presence. The audience is so excited to meet you."

Nathan started to respond, but Dalton was already walking away. Not running, not skulking—walking with measured steps toward the projection booth. He moved like he owned the ground he crossed, completely comfortable in his ruined kingdom.

At the booth stairs he paused, turned back.

"I know what you're thinking," he called out. "That you'll leave before sundown. Drive away, call authorities, bring people with guns." His smile was sad. "But you won't. Because you're filmmakers. Documentarians. And this is the greatest story you'll ever find. You'll stay because you have to know how it ends."

He climbed the stairs and disappeared into the booth.

The group stood in stunned silence.

"He's right," Nathan said finally. "We're staying."

"The hell we are," Greg exploded. "Did you not hear him? He's completely insane! He thinks dead people talk to him! He wants to add us to his collection of murder victims!"

"He said we could leave after the screening," Lisa heard herself say. She didn't believe it, but she said it anyway.

"You trust him?" Kevin asked.

"No. But he's been honest about everything else. His delusion, his motivation, what he wants. Maybe he's honest about this too."

"Or maybe it's a trap," Kevin countered. "One final screening before he kills us all."

Samantha was writing frantically in her notebook. "He's established himself as non-threatening. Sitting down, keeping distance, asking permission. Classical negotiation tactics. He's trying to build rapport."

"Why?" Nathan asked. "If he wanted to kill us, he could have tried already. Poisoned our water, ambushed us, anything. Instead he's inviting us to watch a movie."

"Because that's his fantasy," Lisa said. "Not killing. Not burning. Having a real audience who chooses to watch. Who understands his devotion. If we're forced, we're not really appreciating. If we come willingly..." She trailed off, the implications sinking in.

"Then we're validating his delusion," Samantha finished. "Becoming part of the fantasy. Proving he was right all along—that cinema is worth dying for."

They looked at each other. Five film students in a condemned drive-in, being invited to a screening by a man who'd killed nine people and spent eleven years talking to ghosts.

"We vote," Kevin said. "Like before. Stay for the screening, or leave now. Majority rules."

The vote was quick. Nathan and Samantha for staying—the story, the documentation, the need to understand. Greg for leaving—pure survival instinct. Lisa abstained—she couldn't decide, paralyzed by fear and unwanted sympathy for the broken man who saw murder as art.

Kevin was the tie-breaker. He stood at the window, looking out at the projection booth where Dalton waited.

"We stay," he said finally. "But we stay smart. Armed, alert, with an exit plan. We attend his screening. We film it. And if anything—anything—feels wrong, we abort immediately."

"And if he doesn't let us leave?" Greg asked.

Kevin's expression was grim. "Then we go through him."

Outside, the desert sun climbed toward noon. Six hours until sundown.

Six hours until the final screening.

And somewhere in the booth, Dalton Reed was preparing his masterpiece.

For an audience that might never leave.
