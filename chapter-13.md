# Chapter 13: Dalton Reveals Himself

Lisa couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. The skeletal hand rested on the bottom ladder rung, close enough that she could see dirt crusted under the remaining fingernails. Two fingers missing from the left hand—old scars, clean amputations from some accident years before.

The voice came from just below. Close. Intimate. But he didn't climb. Stayed there at the base of the ladder, giving her space.

"I saw you filming this morning," Dalton said, voice theatrical, strained. "The golden hour light. You understand composition. The way morning transforms decay into beauty. Low angles, patient attention to texture. That's not documentary work. That's art."

He'd been watching her. Analyzing her technique.

"I was just documenting," Lisa managed.

"You were creating," he corrected gently. "Finding meaning in ruins. That's what artists do."

The hand shifted on the ladder. Lisa flinched, but he didn't climb.

"This was a cathedral," he continued, voice taking on a reverent quality. "Do you understand that? Every Friday night, families came here. Not for the stories—they could see those on television for free. They came for the experience. Communal dreaming under stars. Strangers sharing laughter and tears in darkness, connected by flickering light. That's sacred. That's what humanity created to replace church—shared narrative in the dark."

Lisa could picture it. Car headlights arriving at dusk, children in pajamas bouncing with excitement, the smell of popcorn, couples holding hands, the massive screen coming to life. A ritual, repeated weekly, that had meant something to people.

"Jack Rollins killed it," Dalton said, harder now. "My employer. The owner. He didn't understand. To him, it was just business. When attendance dropped, he cut costs. Cheaper films, shorter seasons, deferred maintenance. He was murdering something beautiful to squeeze out profit. I begged him. Showed him the numbers—how quality programming would bring people back. But he wouldn't listen. Said I was just a projectionist. Said I didn't understand commerce."

"So you killed him," Lisa whispered.

Silence. Long enough that Lisa thought she'd made a terrible mistake. The hand tightened on the ladder, wood creaking under pressure.

Then: "I saved the theater," Dalton said quietly. "I showed him what dedication meant. That some people would rather burn than watch art die. I never wanted the others to die. Just him. Just the man destroying it. But they stayed. Watched the flames come. And when they died..." His voice softened. "They understood finally. What it means to give yourself completely to something greater."

Lisa's hands were shaking so badly she had to set down the camera. This was insane. She was crouched in a crawlspace listening to a murderer justify burning nine people alive as an artistic statement.

"What do you want?" she asked. The most important question. "From us. From me. What do you want?"

"To show you," Dalton said simply. "My collection. The films I've preserved. The work I've done maintaining this place for eleven years. Real audience finally seeing what I've built. Real eyes to witness the dedication."

"You've been alone all this time?"

"Not alone. The audience is here. The nine faithful souls. I hear them every night. The Morrison children have learned so much—little Sarah used to cry during scary parts, but now she understands it's all craft. They've grown in death. Become perfect appreciators."

He truly believed it. The delusion was total, unshakeable.

"My friends," Lisa said carefully. "They'll be looking for me soon. They know I came out here."

"I know." The hand withdrew from the ladder. Lisa heard him step back, giving her more space. "The tall one with the camera—Nathan. He sees tragic beauty in ruins. The woman with the notebook—Samantha. She seeks narrative patterns, analyzes structure. The military one—Kevin. He demands proof, thinks in tactics. The frightened one—Greg. He grounds everything in fear, reminds the others of danger. And you. Lisa. The artist who understands light."

He knew their names. Had listened to their conversations, catalogued their personalities like he catalogued his films.

"You're all perfect," Dalton continued, and there was such hope in his voice it made Lisa's chest ache. "Different types of appreciation. A complete audience. For eleven years I've shown films to the faithful nine, and they've been wonderful. But they can't help with repairs. Can't carry supplies. Can't..." He paused. "Can't provide the validation that comes from living eyes."

There it was. The truth underneath the delusion. He was desperately, achingly lonely. Eleven years of talking to ghosts, maintaining a theater for an audience only he could see, preserving something no one living appreciated. He needed them. Needed real people to witness his work, confirm it had meaning.

"If we watch," Lisa said carefully, "if we see your collection, your films, what happens then?"

"Then you understand," Dalton said. "You see what I've sacrificed. What I've preserved. And maybe..." His voice cracked. "Maybe you tell others. Maybe the work continues. Maybe it wasn't all for nothing."

He wanted recognition. Legacy. Proof that eleven years of isolation and madness had purpose.

"Let me see you," Lisa said. She didn't know why she asked. Morbid curiosity maybe. Or the documentarian instinct to witness, to record, to understand.

Movement below. Then he stepped into view through the gaps in the floorboards.

The Polaroid from 1982 hadn't lied. Dalton Reed was barely human in appearance—skeletal frame wrapped in ragged clothing, wild tangled hair and beard sun-bleached almost white, skin weathered to leather by eleven years of desert sun. Barefoot, his feet calloused thick as boot soles. He looked like something that had died and refused to lie down.

But he stood straight. Hands clasped in front of him with careful dignity, like a host receiving guests. And his eyes—sunken deep in skull-like sockets—were sharp. Aware. Completely lucid within the framework of his delusion.

This wasn't a shambling madman. This was someone who'd made deliberate choices and lived with them for over a decade.

"I was handsome once," he said, seeing her stare. "Had prospects. Women. A future. I gave it all up for this place. For the families. For the sacred ritual of communal cinema." He gestured to the theater around them. "Was it worth it? Ask me in moments of clarity, and I don't know. But ask the audience—" He smiled. "They tell me yes. Every night they tell me the sacrifice mattered."

"They're not real," Lisa said, forcing the words out. "The voices. The conversations. You're alone here. You've been alone for eleven years."

The smile didn't fade. "Reality is what we perceive. I perceive them. They're real to me. That's enough."

He turned, walking toward the booth door with measured steps. Lisa watched through the gaps as he moved across the space below.

"Tonight," he called back. "Sundown. I'm preparing a special screening. I've chosen the perfect film—something that speaks to preservation, loss, nostalgia. Something that will help you understand. You'll watch with the audience. All fourteen of us together. The faithful nine and the new five."

"We're not staying," Lisa said. "We're leaving. Today."

Dalton paused at the door. Looked back up at the crawlspace opening where she crouched.

"No," he said gently. "You're filmmakers. Documentarians. This is the greatest story you'll ever find. You'll stay because you have to know how it ends. Because walking away means leaving the most important work of your lives unfinished." His eyes met hers through the gaps. "I know you, Lisa Huang. You won't leave. None of you will. The story has you now."

Then he was gone. The door creaked open. His footsteps descended the external stairs with careful precision.

Lisa stayed frozen, counting to one hundred. Then two hundred. Making absolutely sure he was gone.

Finally, she moved. Scrambled down the ladder with shaking hands, camera banging against her shoulder. The booth was empty, morning sun streaming through the windows. On the floor, the journal lay where she'd set it down. She grabbed it—evidence, proof of everything Dalton had said and done.

The shrine watched from above. Nine faces in photographs, candles still burning, offerings arranged with obsessive devotion.

Lisa ran.

Down the stairs, across the lot without caring about stealth. She reached the snack bar, stumbled through the door, nearly colliding with Nathan and Kevin returning from their perimeter check.

"Lisa!" Nathan grabbed her arms. "What were you doing out there?"

She couldn't speak. Could only shake, the journal clutched tight.

"What happened?" Kevin demanded.

"I met him. Dalton Reed. He's alive. Living in the booth." She looked at them. "He's expecting us tonight. For a screening."

Greg appeared from the back room, face pale. "What?"

Lisa held up the journal. "Eleven years of entries. He talks to the victims. Thinks they're still here watching with him. He wants us to join them. Five new members."

Samantha took the journal, read the recent entries. Her expression shifted from skepticism to horror to fascination. "This is unprecedented. A functional delusional state maintained for over a decade."

"This is a death trap," Kevin corrected. "An arsonist wants us at a private screening."

"He let her go," Nathan said quietly. "Why?"

Lisa remembered Dalton's voice. The desperate hope. "He doesn't want to kill us. He wants validation. Proof that eleven years meant something."

"So we become permanent audience," Greg said. "Like the nine victims."

"Or," Samantha said, "we document this. Film everything. Walk away with the most important footage ever captured."

Kevin laughed without humor. "You want to watch a movie with a killer. On purpose."

"For documentation," Samantha said. "For understanding. For capturing something that won't exist once Dalton dies."

Five film students in the desert, being invited to a screening by a man who'd killed nine people.

"We vote," Nathan said. "Stay for the screening, or leave now."

Lisa looked at the journal. At the shrine she'd filmed. At her friends weighing survival against documentation.

Dalton was right. The story had them now.

The only question was whether they'd survive telling it.
